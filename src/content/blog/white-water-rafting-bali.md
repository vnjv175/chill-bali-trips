Bali has two rivers worth rafting, and they could not be more different. The Ayung River near [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) is the scenic, accessible option — gentle rapids through a stunning river gorge with carved rock faces and waterfalls. The Telaga Waja in East Bali is the adrenaline option — faster water, bigger drops, and a genuine sense of adventure.

Both are excellent. Neither is a wrong choice. But understanding the differences will help you pick the one that matches your group's energy, fitness level, and idea of a good time.

Here is the full comparison.

## Ayung River: The Scenic Route

### Overview

The Ayung is Bali's longest river, cutting through a deep gorge south of Ubud. The rafting section runs about 10-12 kilometers through some of the most beautiful scenery you will find on any river anywhere in the world — towering jungle walls, waterfalls cascading into the river, terraced rice paddies above, and ancient stone carvings on the gorge walls.

The rapids are Class II, occasionally Class III after heavy rain. This means they are exciting enough to get your heart rate up but gentle enough that genuine capsizing is unlikely. The Ayung is designed for fun, not fear.

### What the Ride Feels Like

You start by descending a long staircase into the gorge — about 200 steps down through dense jungle. At the bottom, your raft and guide are waiting.

The first section is calm, giving you a chance to get comfortable with paddling and look around. The gorge walls rise steeply on both sides, covered in moss, ferns, and the occasional waterfall pouring down from above.

Then the rapids begin. They come in sets — a few minutes of gentle paddling, then a section of white water where the guide barks paddling commands and the boat bounces through waves. The rapids are frequent enough to keep things exciting but spaced far enough apart that you are never overwhelmed.

**Highlights along the route:**

- **Stone carvings:** About halfway through the route, one gorge wall has been carved with elaborate Hindu figures and reliefs. They appear suddenly around a bend and are genuinely surprising.
- **Waterfall shower:** The guide will steer the raft directly under a small waterfall, giving everyone a natural shower. In the tropical heat, it feels incredible.
- **Swimming section:** There is usually a calm stretch where the guide allows you to jump out and swim in the river. The water is clean and surprisingly cool.
- **Monkey sightings:** Long-tailed macaques are often visible on the gorge walls above.

The ride ends at a set of stairs leading up to the finishing point, where lunch is served at a restaurant overlooking the gorge.

### Practical Details

| Detail | Ayung River |
|---|---|
| **Rapids class** | II (occasionally III) |
| **Distance** | 10-12 km |
| **Duration** | 1.5-2 hours on the water |
| **Total time** | 3-4 hours including transport |
| **Minimum age** | 5-7 years (varies by operator) |
| **Swimming ability** | Not required (life jackets provided) |
| **Price** | $30-50 per person |

### Who Should Choose the Ayung

- First-time rafters
- Families with children
- Travelers who want scenery over adrenaline
- Anyone staying near [Ubud](/areas/ubud/), [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/), or [Canggu](/areas/canggu/) (closer pickup)

## Telaga Waja: The Adventure Route

### Overview

The Telaga Waja flows down from the slopes of Mount Agung in East Bali, and it carries the mountain's attitude with it. The rafting section runs about 16 kilometers through Class III rapids, with occasional Class IV sections after heavy rain. The river is faster, the drops are bigger, and the sections of calm water between rapids are shorter.

This is a real rafting experience. You will get wet, you might get thrown around, and you will feel the kind of buzz that only comes from doing something that feels genuinely wild.

### What the Ride Feels Like

The access is easier than the Ayung — a shorter walk down to the river. But from the moment you launch, it is clear this is a different caliber of river.

The rapids start earlier and hit harder. The Telaga Waja has more technical sections where the guide needs genuine skill to navigate the raft through rocks and drops. There are moments where the raft drops over small ledges and everyone gets airborne for a half-second. There are moments where a wave hits the bow and drenches the front paddlers completely.

**Highlights along the route:**

- **The drop:** About two-thirds of the way through, there is a significant drop — roughly a 4-meter waterfall that the raft goes over. The guide will prepare you, but the sensation of the raft tipping over the edge and landing in the pool below is the kind of thing you do not forget.
- **Volume and speed:** The Telaga Waja carries more water than the Ayung, especially in wet season. The rapids feel more powerful and the current moves faster.
- **Gorge sections:** While less ornate than the Ayung's carved walls, the Telaga Waja gorge has its own raw beauty — dark rock walls, jungle canopy overhead, and the constant sound of rushing water.
- **The finale:** The last few rapids are some of the biggest, so you finish on a high rather than a gentle float to shore.

After the ride, you climb a set of stairs to a restaurant where a buffet lunch is served. Your legs will be shaky from bracing in the raft, and you will be hungrier than you expected.

### Practical Details

| Detail | Telaga Waja |
|---|---|
| **Rapids class** | III (occasionally IV) |
| **Distance** | 16 km |
| **Duration** | 2-2.5 hours on the water |
| **Total time** | 5-6 hours including transport |
| **Minimum age** | 10-12 years (varies by operator) |
| **Swimming ability** | Recommended |
| **Price** | $35-55 per person |

### Who Should Choose the Telaga Waja

- Experienced or adventurous rafters
- Thrill seekers and adrenaline lovers
- Fit travelers comfortable in water
- Groups of friends looking for a shared adventure
- Anyone who has done the Ayung before and wants more
- Travelers staying in East Bali or planning to visit [temples](/activities/temple-tours/) in the Karangasem area

## Can You Do Both?

Yes, but not on the same day. Each rafting trip takes 3-6 hours total, and the rivers are in completely different parts of the island. If you have a week or more in Bali, doing both gives you the full spectrum of Bali rafting — the beauty of the Ayung and the thrill of the Telaga Waja.

A good approach: do the Ayung early in your trip when you are settling in, and save the Telaga Waja for later when you are feeling more adventurous and comfortable with Bali's water.

## What to Bring

The essentials are the same for both rivers:

- **Swimwear or quick-dry clothing** — you will be completely soaked
- **Water shoes or sandals with straps** — flip-flops will come off in the rapids
- **Sunscreen** — applied before you launch (waterproof formula recommended)
- **Waterproof phone case** — if you want to take photos on the river. A proper waterproof case, not a zip-lock bag
- **Change of clothes** — for after the ride
- **A small amount of cash** — for tips and any drinks not included in the package
- **Nothing you cannot afford to lose** — things can fall out of the raft in rapids

### What to Leave Behind

- Valuables, expensive jewelry, and anything that cannot get wet
- Glasses without a strap (they will fly off your face on the first rapid)
- Large cameras (use a GoPro or phone in a waterproof case instead)
- Heavy shoes (they fill with water and weigh you down)

## What is Included in the Price

Most rafting packages include:

- **Hotel pickup and drop-off** from major tourist areas ([Ubud](/areas/ubud/), [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/), [Canggu](/areas/canggu/), [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/))
- **All equipment** — life jacket, helmet, paddle
- **Professional rafting guide** — one guide per raft (4-6 people per raft)
- **Buffet lunch** at the finish point
- **Shower and changing facilities**
- **Insurance**
- **Towel** (at some operators)

### What is Not Included

- Professional photos (photographers station themselves along the route and at the big drops — photos cost $10-20)
- Tips for your guide (50,000-100,000 IDR is appreciated, especially if they kept everyone safe and laughing)
- Any drinks beyond water at lunch

## Safety

[White water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/) in Bali has an excellent safety record. The major operators run multiple trips daily, and their guides are experienced professionals who know every rock, eddy, and current on their river.

### Standard Safety Measures

- Life jackets are mandatory and properly fitted before launching
- Helmets are mandatory on both rivers
- Guides conduct a safety briefing covering paddling technique, what to do if you fall out, and river-specific hazards
- Each raft has one trained guide
- Rescue kayakers are positioned at the most challenging rapids on the Telaga Waja

### Conditions That Affect Safety

- **Heavy rain:** Both rivers rise significantly after sustained rainfall. Some operators cancel trips when the water level is too high. This is a safety decision, not an inconvenience.
- **Wet season vs. dry season:** Wet season (November to March) means higher water levels and stronger currents. The Telaga Waja in particular gets noticeably more intense. Dry season is more predictable.
- **Your fitness and swimming ability:** On the Ayung, non-swimmers are fine with a life jacket. On the Telaga Waja, being able to swim gives you confidence and safety margin if you end up in the water.

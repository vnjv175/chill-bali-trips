Bali sits in the middle of some of the richest fishing waters in the Indonesian archipelago. The deep channels between Bali and Lombok, the nutrient-rich upwellings south of the Bukit peninsula, and the warm currents of the Indian Ocean create conditions that attract everything from yellowfin tuna and mahi-mahi to giant trevally and blue marlin.

Whether you're an experienced angler looking to tick off bucket-list species or a casual traveler who just wants a morning on the water, South Bali has options ranging from full-day offshore charters to relaxed shore fishing sessions.

## Deep Sea Fishing Charters

### Where They Depart From

Almost all deep sea charters in South Bali leave from Benoa Harbour (Tanjung Benoa), which sits on the narrow peninsula between Sanur and Nusa Dua. It's the main marina for sport fishing boats in the region and is easily accessible from Seminyak, Kuta, Nusa Dua, and Jimbaran — typically 20-40 minutes by car depending on traffic.

A few operators also run trips from Serangan Island (Turtle Island), which is connected to the mainland by a bridge just south of Sanur.

### What You'll Be Fishing For

The species you target depend on the season, conditions, and how far offshore you go.

**Year-round species:**
- **Mahi-Mahi (Dorado):** One of the most common catches. Beautiful fish, great fighters, excellent eating. Found around floating debris and weed lines.
- **Yellowfin Tuna:** Bali's waters hold solid yellowfin populations. Fish in the 10-30 kg range are common, with bigger specimens possible in peak season.
- **Wahoo:** Fast, powerful fish found in deeper offshore waters. Less common than tuna but a prized catch.
- **Giant Trevally (GT):** Found around reef structures and drop-offs. Hard-fighting and aggressive — a favorite among sport anglers.

**Seasonal highlights:**
- **Blue Marlin (October-April):** The main event for serious game fishers. The waters south of Bali hold blue marlin in the 50-200 kg range, with bigger fish always possible.
- **Sailfish (March-July):** Fast and acrobatic. Often found in packs, so multiple hookups in a session aren't uncommon.
- **Barracuda (year-round, peaks in dry season):** Frequently caught as a bonus species while trolling for tuna.

### Types of Charter Trips

**Half-Day Trips (4-5 hours)**

Depart early morning (around 6-7 AM) and return by midday. You'll fish the waters within 5-15 nautical miles of shore, targeting tuna, mahi-mahi, trevally, and reef species. This is the most popular option for visitors who want a fishing experience without committing the whole day.

**Cost:** $250-500 USD for a private boat (typically fits 4-6 anglers). Some operators offer shared trips at $80-120 per person.

**Best for:** Families, casual anglers, or anyone with limited time.

**Full-Day Trips (8-10 hours)**

Head further offshore into deeper water where the bigger pelagic species roam. Full-day trips give you time to troll the deep-water FADs (fish aggregating devices), work the current lines, and try different techniques — trolling, jigging, and bottom fishing.

**Cost:** $450-900 USD for a private boat. Shared trips run $150-250 per person.

**Best for:** Experienced anglers, anyone targeting marlin or large tuna.

**Overnight / Multi-Day Trips**

Some operators offer overnight trips to more distant fishing grounds around Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, or the deeper channels toward Lombok. These are specialized trips for serious anglers and usually need to be arranged well in advance.

**Cost:** $800-1,500+ USD depending on duration and boat.

### Choosing a Charter Operator

Not all charter boats in Benoa are created equal. Here's what to look for:

- **Boat condition:** A well-maintained vessel with proper safety equipment, a shaded area, and a bathroom. Ask for photos if booking remotely.
- **Equipment quality:** Good operators provide quality rods, reels, tackle, and lures. Penn, Shimano, or similar brands are a good sign. Cheap gear means lost fish.
- **Crew experience:** An experienced captain who knows the local waters is worth more than a fancy boat. Ask how long they've been running charters in Bali.
- **What's included:** Confirm whether bait, tackle, ice, drinks, and lunch are included. Some budget operators charge extra for everything.
- **Catch policy:** Clarify whether you keep the fish, the crew keeps it, or you share. Most sport fishing charters practice tag-and-release for billfish (marlin and sailfish).

### What to Bring

The charter provides all the fishing gear, but you should bring:

- Sunscreen (reef-safe is preferred) and reapply often — reflected UV off the water is brutal
- Sunglasses with polarized lenses
- A hat with a brim
- Light long-sleeved shirt for sun protection
- Motion sickness medication if you're prone to seasickness — take it before boarding, not after you feel queasy
- A light rain jacket during wet season
- Camera or waterproof phone case

### Seasickness: The Honest Truth

The waters south of Bali can be choppy, especially during the transition months. If you don't have your sea legs, take Dramamine or a similar medication 30-60 minutes before departure. Ginger tablets and acupressure wristbands also help some people.

Sitting toward the back of the boat, keeping your eyes on the horizon, and staying hydrated all reduce the odds of getting sick. Avoid reading your phone or looking down for extended periods.

## Shore Fishing in South Bali

Not everyone wants to spend half a day on a boat, and that's fine. South Bali has several shore fishing spots where you can cast a line without spending much money at all.

### Popular Shore Fishing Spots

**Sanur Beach**

The reef-protected waters along Sanur's beachfront offer calm conditions and a variety of smaller reef species. It's not going to produce trophy fish, but it's a pleasant morning activity, especially for families or beginners. Fish from the beach at low tide or from the breakwater structures.

**Species:** Small trevally, snapper, wrasse, and occasional barracuda.

**Jimbaran Bay**

The southern end of Jimbaran Bay near the fish market has rocky outcrops that hold reef species. It's best at dawn and dusk when the fish are feeding. You'll see local fishermen here, which is always a good sign.

**Species:** Snapper, grouper, small tuna.

**The Bukit Peninsula (Cliff Fishing)**

For the more adventurous, the limestone cliffs along the Bukit Peninsula (around Uluwatu and Balangan) offer access to deeper water close to shore. This is not beginner-friendly — you need to be confident on uneven, sometimes slippery rock and aware of the swell. But the fishing can be excellent, with access to reef edges that hold GT, coral trout, and snapper.

**Species:** Giant trevally, coral trout, red snapper, queenfish.

**Serangan Island**

The channel near Serangan (Turtle Island) has deeper water close to shore and is accessible by a bridge from Sanur. The breakwaters and rocky edges produce decent catches, particularly around dawn and the changing tides.

**Species:** Trevally, barracuda, snapper, queenfish.

### Gear for Shore Fishing

If you want to fish from shore, you'll need your own gear since there aren't formal rental shops for beach fishing. Options include:

- **Buy locally:** Basic rods and tackle are available at fishing supply shops in Denpasar and Sanur. A functional setup costs 200,000-500,000 IDR ($13-32 USD).
- **Bring your own:** If you're a keen angler, packing a travel rod is the best option. A compact spinning rod (7-8ft) with a 3000-4000 size reel covers most shore fishing scenarios.
- **Bait:** Fresh bait is available at local fish markets, especially Jimbaran and Kedonganan. Squid, prawns, and small baitfish all work.

## Best Time of Year for Fishing in Bali

**Dry Season (April-October):** Calmer seas, more comfortable boat trips, consistent catches of tuna, mahi-mahi, and trevally. The best all-round season for fishing.

**Wet Season (November-March):** Rougher seas but warmer water temperatures attract pelagic species. This is peak marlin season. Be prepared for occasional trip cancellations due to weather.

**Transition Months (April-May, September-October):** Often the sweet spot — good weather with species from both seasons present in the water.

## What Happens to Your Catch

On most charter boats, the crew will clean and fillet your catch at the dock. Many restaurants in Jimbaran and Sanur will cook your fresh-caught fish for you — just bring it in and they'll grill, fry, or steam it for a small fee. The famous Jimbaran Bay seafood restaurants are the ideal place for this.

There's something deeply satisfying about eating fish you caught that morning while watching the sunset over the Indian Ocean.

## Combining Fishing with Other Activities

A morning fishing charter wraps up around midday, leaving plenty of time for other South Bali activities in the afternoon. Consider pairing your trip with a visit to the [Bali Zoo or Safari Park](/blog/bali-zoo-safari-park/) for a full day, or head to one of the Bukit peninsula's beach clubs for sunset.

If you're staying in the area for a few days, a [Nusa Penida day trip](/blog/nusa-penida-day-trip/) also departs from the same harbor area, making it easy to plan a water-focused itinerary.

[Ubud](/areas/ubud/) sits in the cultural heart of Bali, surrounded by terraced rice paddies, river valleys, and volcanic highlands. It is one of the best base locations on the island — not just for what is in Ubud itself, but for what you can reach within a short drive.

Unlike staying on the south coast where you often fight traffic just to leave your area, Ubud's central position gives you fast access to Bali's mountains, waterfalls, east coast, and northern highlands. Many of the island's best experiences are under an hour away.

Here are the day trips that make staying in Ubud such a strategic choice.

## Mount Batur Sunrise Trek

**Drive time from Ubud:** 45 minutes to 1 hour

This is the number one day trip from Ubud, and for good reason. The [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) is one of Bali's most iconic experiences, and Ubud is the closest major tourist area to the trailhead.

### The Experience

Your driver picks you up around 3 AM. You arrive at the base camp in Kintamani by 4 AM, meet your guide, and begin the ascent in darkness with headlamps. The trail is well-worn but steep in sections — expect about 2 hours of solid hiking.

The payoff is extraordinary. As you reach the summit at 1,717 meters, the sky begins to lighten. Then the sun breaks over the horizon, illuminating the vast caldera lake below and Mount Agung towering in the distance. Breakfast is cooked using volcanic steam vents right on the summit.

You descend by mid-morning and can add a soak in the natural hot springs at Toya Devasya before heading back. Most people are back in Ubud by noon, leaving the afternoon free.

**What to know:** The trek is moderate difficulty. You do not need to be an athlete, but decent shoes and a reasonable level of fitness are important. It gets cold at the summit — bring a light jacket.

## The Waterfall Circuit

**Drive time from Ubud:** 15-45 minutes (varies by waterfall)

Bali has more waterfalls than most people realize, and many of the best are clustered in the valleys and hillsides surrounding Ubud. A dedicated [waterfall day](/activities/waterfall-tours/) is one of the most rewarding things you can do on the island.

### Best Route from Ubud

**First stop — Tibumana Waterfall (20 min from Ubud):** A hidden gem reached via a short walk through bamboo forest. The pool is perfect for swimming, and you will often have it to yourself early in the morning.

**Second stop — Kanto Lampo Waterfall (15 min from Ubud):** Water cascades over a dramatic stepped rock formation. One of the most photogenic falls in Bali. Quick visit — 30 minutes is enough.

**Third stop — Tukad Cepung Waterfall (40 min from Ubud):** This is the showstopper. You walk through a narrow river gorge into a cave where water pours down from a crack in the rock above. When the sun is overhead (10 AM-12 PM), beams of light cut through the mist. It is genuinely one of the most magical natural sights in Bali.

**Fourth stop — Tegenungan Waterfall (25 min from Ubud):** The most famous and most accessible of the group. Powerful falls, large swimming area, and cafe overlooking the gorge. Visit in the afternoon when the morning crowds have thinned.

**Bonus — Sekumpul Waterfall (1.5 hours from Ubud):** If you want to go further, Sekumpul is widely considered the most beautiful waterfall in Bali. It requires a genuine hike (about 45 minutes down and back up), but the multi-stream falls surrounded by tropical jungle are worth every step.

## Sidemen Valley: Bali Without the Crowds

**Drive time from Ubud:** 1-1.5 hours

If you want to see what Bali looks like without mass tourism, drive east to Sidemen. This valley in Karangasem regency is one of the most beautiful landscapes on the island — terraced rice paddies climbing up the slopes of Mount Agung, traditional weaving villages, and an almost complete absence of tourist infrastructure.

### What to Do

- **Walk the rice terraces.** Unlike Tegallalang, where you share the paths with hundreds of visitors, the rice terraces around Sidemen are quiet. You can walk for an hour through the paddies and encounter only farmers.
- **Visit a weaving village.** Sidemen is known for traditional ikat weaving. You can watch artisans work on hand-loomed textiles using techniques passed down for generations.
- **Swim in the river.** The Unda River runs through the valley and has natural swimming spots that locals use.
- **Eat at a warung with a view.** Several simple restaurants along the road offer unobstructed views of Mount Agung across the rice fields.

Sidemen is not a place for ticking off attractions. It is a place for slowing down and absorbing a side of Bali that most visitors never see.

## Tirta Gangga & East Bali Temples

**Drive time from Ubud:** 1.5-2 hours

East Bali is home to some of the island's most stunning temple complexes and a landscape that grows more dramatic as you approach Mount Agung.

### The Route

**Tirta Gangga Water Palace:** A former royal water garden built in 1946, featuring ornate fountains, koi ponds, and stepping stone paths across the water. The surrounding gardens are peaceful and beautifully maintained. This is one of Bali's most photogenic spots.

**Lempuyang Temple (Gates of Heaven):** The famous shot of Mount Agung framed perfectly within the temple's split gate has made this one of the most Instagrammed spots in Bali. The reality is that the queue for the photo can be 1-2 hours long during peak times. Go early (before 8 AM) or accept the wait.

The full Lempuyang complex has seven temples ascending the mountainside. Most visitors only see the first (where the photo is taken), but hiking to the upper temples is a rewarding half-day trek for those with the energy.

**Besakih (Mother Temple):** Bali's largest and most important Hindu temple complex sits on the slopes of Mount Agung at 1,000 meters. It is vast, ornate, and deeply significant — 23 separate temples spread across the mountainside. The views from here on a clear day are extraordinary.

**Tip:** Besakih has a reputation for aggressive guides and touts at the entrance. This has improved in recent years, but be firm about hiring your own guide or exploring independently.

## Kintamani & the Volcanic Highlands

**Drive time from Ubud:** 1 hour

Even if you are not doing the sunrise trek, the Kintamani region is worth a day trip for the scenery alone. The area around Mount Batur and its caldera lake offers some of the most dramatic landscapes in Bali.

### What to Do

- **Caldera rim viewpoint:** Several restaurants and cafes line the rim of the caldera with panoramic views of Mount Batur, the lake, and the lava fields from the most recent eruption. Having lunch here with this view is unforgettable.
- **Toya Devasya Hot Springs:** Natural hot springs on the shore of Lake Batur, heated by volcanic activity. Multiple pools at different temperatures, plus a swimming pool with lake views.
- **[Coffee plantation tour](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/):** The highlands around Kintamani are where Balinese coffee is grown. Several plantations offer tours where you can learn about (and taste) various blends, including the famous Luwak coffee.
- **[Cycling tour](/activities/cycling-tours/):** One of Bali's best-value activities is a downhill cycling tour from Kintamani back to Ubud. You coast through traditional villages, rice paddies, and tropical forest with minimal pedaling effort.

## Jatiluwih Rice Terraces

**Drive time from Ubud:** 1-1.5 hours

The Tegallalang terraces near Ubud get all the attention, but Jatiluwih in Tabanan regency is the UNESCO World Heritage Site — and it is the more impressive landscape by a wide margin.

### Why Jatiluwih Is Worth the Drive

The scale is completely different. Where Tegallalang is a compact, photogenic terrace along a single valley, Jatiluwih is an enormous expanse of rice paddies rolling across the slopes with Mount Batukaru rising behind them. Multiple walking trails of varying length (30 minutes to 3 hours) wind through the paddies, and you will share them with very few other visitors.

The subak irrigation system here — the traditional Balinese cooperative water management that earned the UNESCO recognition — is visible in its full working form. Farmers still tend these terraces using methods that have not changed in centuries.

**Combine with:** Tanah Lot temple on the way back for a sunset visit. The route from Jatiluwih south to Tanah Lot is scenic and takes about an hour.

## White Water Rafting

**Drive time from Ubud:** 15-30 minutes to the Ayung River put-in

The Ayung River runs through a gorge just south of Ubud, making [white water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/) one of the most convenient adventure activities from an Ubud base.

### What to Expect

The Ayung has Class II rapids — exciting enough to get the adrenaline going but suitable for beginners and families. The 2-hour journey passes through a dramatic jungle gorge with 10-meter carved rock faces, small waterfalls, and dense tropical vegetation on both sides.

For more intense rapids, the Telaga Waja River in east Bali (1.5 hours from Ubud) has Class III-IV sections that are genuinely thrilling.

Both operators typically include lunch, and the Ayung trips finish close to Ubud, so the rest of your day is free.

## Nusa Penida

**Travel time from Ubud:** 1-1.5 hours to Sanur harbor + 30-45 minute fast boat

A [Nusa Penida day trip](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/) from Ubud requires an early start but is absolutely worth it. The island's raw, undeveloped coastline features some of the most dramatic scenery in Indonesia.

### The Highlights

- **Kelingking Beach:** The famous T-Rex cliff viewpoint. The view from the top is free and staggering. The climb down to the beach is steep and strenuous.
- **Angel's Billabong:** A natural rock pool where the ocean meets the cliff. Swim at low tide only.
- **Broken Beach:** A circular cove with a natural rock bridge overhead. Views only, no access to the water.
- **Crystal Bay:** Calm water, good snorkeling, and a sandy beach for relaxing.

**Logistics:** You will need a local driver on Nusa Penida (the roads are rough and require local knowledge). Most day trip packages include the boat, driver, and lunch. Depart Sanur by 8 AM to maximize your time on the island.

## ATV & Quad Biking Through the Countryside

**Drive time from Ubud:** 15-30 minutes

[ATV quad biking](/activities/atv-quad-biking/) through the countryside around Ubud is one of the most fun adventure activities on the island. Routes pass through rice paddies, jungle trails, river crossings, and traditional villages — terrain that would be difficult to access on foot or by car.

### What to Know

Most operators offer 2-hour tours that cover a good variety of terrain. You will get muddy. You will get splashed crossing rivers. You will have a great time.

The longer courses are significantly better than the short ones — the first 30 minutes is just getting comfortable on the ATV, and the good stuff comes in the second hour.

**Best for:** Couples, groups, and anyone who wants an adventure that does not require extreme fitness.

## Pura Tirta Empul: The Sacred Water Temple

**Drive time from Ubud:** 30 minutes

While technically close enough to visit in an afternoon rather than a full day trip, [Tirta Empul](/activities/temple-tours/) deserves dedicated time. This thousand-year-old temple is built around a natural spring that Balinese Hindus consider sacred.

### The Purification Ritual

Visitors can participate in the melukat purification ceremony — wading into the spring pools and moving through a sequence of fountains while making prayers. It is one of the most meaningful cultural experiences available to tourists in Bali, and it is worth approaching with genuine respect and intention rather than treating it as a photo opportunity.

**Combine with:** Gunung Kawi, a stunning 11th-century rock-cut temple reached by descending 300 steps through rice terraces. It is only 15 minutes from Tirta Empul and rarely crowded.

## Tips for Day Trips from Ubud

1. **Hire a private driver.** A [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) for a full day costs $40-60 and transforms your experience. They handle navigation, parking, and can suggest stops you would never find on your own.

2. **Start early.** Ubud's roads get congested by mid-morning. A 7 AM departure gives you the best roads and the emptiest attractions.

3. **Layer your clothing.** The highlands around Kintamani and Mount Batur are noticeably cooler than Ubud, especially in the early morning. Bring a light layer.

4. **Carry cash and small bills.** Entrance fees, parking, and rural warungs are cash-only. Having 10,000 and 20,000 rupiah notes ready saves hassle.

5. **Respect temple dress codes.** Sarongs and sashes are required at all Balinese temples. Major temples provide them, but having your own is more hygienic and respectful.

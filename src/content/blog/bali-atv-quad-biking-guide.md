There is something deeply satisfying about blasting through a Balinese rice paddy on a quad bike, mud flying everywhere, with a volcanic mountain in the background. [ATV riding](/activities/atv-quad-biking/) is one of Bali's most popular adventure activities, and it is easy to see why — it is accessible to almost everyone, does not require any prior experience, and takes you through landscapes you would never see from a car or on foot.

But not all ATV tours are created equal. The difference between a great one and a disappointing one comes down to course length, terrain variety, and equipment quality. This guide covers everything you need to know to choose the right tour and get the most out of the experience.

## What to Expect on a Bali ATV Tour

A typical ATV tour in Bali runs between 1.5 and 3 hours of actual riding time, with additional time for transport, briefing, and cleanup. Here is how a standard tour plays out:

### Before You Ride

You arrive at the ATV camp, usually in a rural area near [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) or Tabanan. After registration, you get a safety briefing covering how to operate the ATV — throttle, brakes, steering, and basic trail rules. You are fitted with a helmet and sometimes boots (though bringing your own closed-toe shoes is recommended).

The briefing takes about 15-20 minutes. If you have driven a car or ridden a bicycle, you will pick it up immediately. The controls are simple — a thumb throttle on the right handlebar and hand brakes.

### The Ride

A guide leads the group single-file through a variety of terrain. The best courses include:

- **Rice terraces** — riding along narrow raised paths between flooded paddies, with sweeping green views on both sides
- **Jungle trails** — single-track paths through dense tropical forest with overhanging trees and vines
- **River crossings** — splashing through shallow rivers, the highlight for most riders
- **Village paths** — passing through traditional Balinese villages where locals wave from their doorsteps
- **Gorges and ravines** — descending into steep-sided valleys with dramatic rock formations
- **Muddy sections** — the messier the better, especially after rain

The guide controls the pace. In sections with good visibility, you can open up the throttle and pick up speed. In technical sections, you slow down and navigate carefully. There is usually one guide at the front and one at the back of the group.

### After the Ride

You return to base absolutely covered in mud and sweat. Most camps provide basic shower facilities, a towel, and sometimes a change of clothes. A buffet lunch or simple meal is typically included in the price.

## Short Course vs. Long Course

This is the single most important decision when booking. Most operators offer two options:

### Short Course (1-1.5 hours riding)

- Covers the basics — some rice paddies, a bit of jungle, maybe one river crossing
- Good for families with young children or people unsure about the activity
- Costs $30-45 per person
- The honest truth: it ends right when it starts getting fun

### Long Course (2-3 hours riding)

- Covers significantly more terrain with greater variety
- Includes the more adventurous sections — deeper river crossings, steeper hills, muddier trails
- Costs $50-75 per person
- Universally recommended. Every traveler Gede has talked to who did the short course wished they had done the long one.

**The verdict:** Book the long course. The extra $20-30 is the best value upgrade in Bali activities.

## Best ATV Courses in Bali

### Ubud Area

The most popular region for ATV riding, with courses that wind through Ubud's signature rice terrace landscapes and river valleys. The terrain is lush and green year-round, with plenty of variety between paddies, jungle, and villages.

**Best for:** First-timers, families, and anyone who wants the classic Bali scenery
**Terrain highlights:** Tegallalang-area rice terraces, Ayung River gorge, jungle trails
**Combine with:** A [waterfall visit](/activities/waterfall-tours/) or [cooking class](/activities/cooking-classes/) in Ubud

### Tabanan Area

Less touristy than Ubud, Tabanan offers wider open rice fields, steeper terrain, and courses that pass through genuine working agricultural land rather than tourist-oriented trails. The views of Mount Batukaru add a dramatic backdrop.

**Best for:** Riders who want more challenging terrain and fewer other tourists
**Terrain highlights:** Wide rice fields, volcanic soil trails, deeper mud sections
**Combine with:** Jatiluwih Rice Terraces (UNESCO World Heritage Site)

### Kintamani / Batur Area

Some operators offer courses in the volcanic highlands near Mount Batur. The terrain here is completely different — black volcanic soil, sparse vegetation, and views of the caldera lake. These courses tend to be newer and less crowded.

**Best for:** Travelers who have already done the [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) and want to explore the area further
**Terrain highlights:** Volcanic landscapes, black sand trails, highland views
**Combine with:** Hot springs, [coffee plantation tour](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/)

## Who Can Ride?

### Age Requirements

- **Solo riders:** Most operators require riders to be at least 16 years old
- **Tandem riders (passenger behind a guide):** Children as young as 5-7 can usually ride as passengers
- **Family ATVs:** Some courses offer tandem bikes where a child sits in front of an adult driver

### Fitness Level

ATV riding does not require serious fitness, but it does involve:

- Gripping handlebars for 1-3 hours (forearms get tired)
- Absorbing bumps and vibrations through your legs and core
- Some upper body work to steer through mud and on uneven terrain

People with back problems, recent injuries, or limited upper body strength should consider the short course or talk to the operator about easier routes.

### Pregnant Travelers

ATV riding is not recommended during pregnancy due to the vibrations, bumps, and jolts inherent to off-road riding.

## What to Wear and Bring

### Wear

- **Closed-toe shoes** that you do not mind getting muddy (old sneakers or hiking sandals with straps are ideal)
- **Lightweight, long pants or leggings** — shorts work but your legs will get splattered with mud
- **A t-shirt or light long sleeve** you do not care about — it will be covered in mud
- **Avoid white clothing** unless you want a souvenir of a very different kind

### Bring

- **Sunscreen** — applied before the ride since you will not be able to reapply
- **A change of clothes** for after the ride
- **A waterproof phone case or dry bag** if you want to take photos (GoPro mounts are available on most ATVs)
- **Cash** for tips and any extras
- **Nothing valuable that cannot get wet or muddy**

### Leave Behind

- Jewelry, watches, and expensive sunglasses — they will get muddy or lost
- Flip-flops — absolutely not suitable for ATV riding
- Large bags — leave them in the car or at the camp's storage area

## Safety Considerations

ATV riding in Bali is generally safe when you ride with a reputable operator, but it is an adventure activity with inherent risks.

### How to Stay Safe

- **Listen to the briefing.** The safety instructions exist because people have been hurt ignoring them.
- **Follow the guide's speed.** If the guide is going slowly, there is a reason.
- **Do not tailgate.** Keep at least two bike-lengths behind the rider in front of you. If they stop suddenly and you are too close, you will rear-end them.
- **Use the brakes, not the throttle, on downhills.** Gravity does the work. Your job is to control the speed.
- **Lean your body weight into turns.** The ATV handles better when you shift your weight rather than just steering with the handlebars.
- **If you are uncomfortable, speak up.** The guides can adjust the route or pace.

### Common Injuries and How to Avoid Them

- **Thumb fatigue or blisters** — wear lightweight gloves or adjust your grip regularly
- **Mud in eyes** — some operators provide goggles, or bring your own
- **Scratches from vegetation** — long sleeves and pants minimize this
- **Falls** — almost always happen when going too fast on turns or not braking on downhills. Follow the guide's lead.

### Choosing a Safe Operator

Look for:
- ATVs in good condition with working brakes and throttle
- Mandatory safety briefings (skip any operator that does not brief you)
- Helmets provided for all riders
- Guides who ride with you (not just point you in a direction)
- A reasonable group size (6-10 riders per guide is standard)

## When to Ride

### Best Time of Day

- **Morning (8-10 AM):** Cooler temperatures, better light for photos, trails are fresher
- **Afternoon (2-4 PM):** Hotter but the mud can be better if it rained in the morning

### Best Season

- **Wet season (November to March):** Muddier trails, more splashing, more fun — but also more slippery sections. The mud adds to the adventure.
- **Dry season (April to October):** Drier trails, less mud, slightly less exciting but easier to control the ATV.

Both seasons work well. Wet season is marginally more fun if you enjoy getting filthy.

## Combining ATV with Other Activities

ATV riding takes about a half-day including transport, so you have time to combine it with other activities:

- **Morning ATV + Afternoon [white water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/):** The ultimate adventure day near Ubud. Both activities are in the same area, so there is minimal driving between them.
- **Morning ATV + Afternoon Tegallalang Rice Terraces:** After getting muddy on the trails, clean up and walk through the famous rice terraces at a leisurely pace.
- **Morning [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) + Afternoon ATV:** If you are an absolute machine and want to pack a volcano hike and ATV riding into one day.
- **ATV + [Bali Swing](/activities/bali-swing/):** Both are near Ubud, and the swing makes for a great post-ride activity while your legs recover.

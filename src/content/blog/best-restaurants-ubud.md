Ubud's dining scene is unlike anywhere else in Bali. While the southern beach towns chase international trends and flashy presentation, Ubud leans into something more grounded — organic produce from local farms, ancient Balinese recipes prepared with genuine care, and a wellness-oriented food culture that goes beyond trendy smoothie bowls.

That said, [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) has evolved far past its roots as a backpacker stopover. You'll find genuine fine dining here now, world-class vegetarian cooking, and some of the most atmospheric restaurant settings on the island — think candlelit tables overlooking jungle ravines and rice terraces glowing in golden afternoon light.

This guide covers the best restaurants in Ubud across every cuisine and price bracket, from the $2 warungs that locals eat at daily to the destination restaurants that people fly to Bali specifically to visit.

## Balinese & Indonesian Cuisine

### Warung Ibu Oka (Budget: $3-7)

Anthony Bourdain put Ibu Oka on the map when he called their babi guling (suckling pig) one of the best things he'd ever eaten. Decades later, the lines still form early. The pig is slow-roasted over coconut husks until the skin shatters like glass and the meat falls apart at the touch of a fork. You get a heaped plate of rice, crispy skin, lawar, and blood sausage for around $4. There's nothing fancy about the setting — plastic chairs, communal tables — but the food is extraordinary.

**Order this:** Babi Guling Special (large portion with extra skin)

### Warung Babi Guling Chandra (Budget: $3-6)

The locals' alternative to Ibu Oka — less famous, arguably just as good, and without the tourist crowds. Chandra's version has a slightly different spice profile, with more turmeric and galangal. They also sell out early, so aim for a late-morning visit.

**Order this:** Nasi Babi Guling, Sate Lilit

### Locavore (Budget: $80-150)

Locavore isn't just Ubud's best restaurant — it's one of the best restaurants in all of Southeast Asia. Chefs Eelke Plasmeijer and Ray Adriansyah built their reputation on hyper-local sourcing: every ingredient on the plate comes from Indonesian producers, with many grown on their own farm. The tasting menu changes constantly and pushes boundaries while remaining deeply rooted in the flavors of the archipelago. Book well in advance — tables fill up weeks ahead.

**Order this:** The Tasting Menu (there's no other way to do it)

### Nusantara by Locavore (Budget: $15-30)

The more accessible sibling of Locavore, Nusantara serves dishes inspired by traditional recipes from across Indonesia's thousands of islands. The concept is preservation through innovation — ancient flavors given modern technique without losing their soul. The rawon (Javanese black beef soup) and rendang are both remarkable.

**Order this:** Rawon, Nasi Campur Nusantara, Rendang

### Bebek Bengil (Dirty Duck Diner) (Budget: $8-15)

A Ubud institution since 1990, Bebek Bengil earned its "Dirty Duck" nickname from the ducks that used to waddle through the rice paddies surrounding the restaurant. The crispy duck is still the star — marinated in Balinese spices, steamed until tender, then deep-fried until the skin goes impossibly crispy. The rice paddy setting remains gorgeous despite the restaurant's growth over the years.

**Order this:** Crispy Duck, Bebek Betutu

## Vegetarian & Vegan

Ubud is arguably the best place in Southeast Asia for plant-based eating. The concentration of quality vegetarian and vegan restaurants here is remarkable.

### Sage (Budget: $8-18)

Sage approaches plant-based cooking with the seriousness of a fine dining kitchen. Dishes are inventive and technically accomplished — not just bowls of grains and vegetables, but genuinely creative plates that change the way you think about vegan food. The jackfruit "pulled pork" burger and mushroom risotto are both exceptional. The space is intimate and beautifully designed.

**Order this:** Jackfruit Burger, Mushroom Risotto, Raw Cheesecake

### Alchemy (Budget: $6-15)

The godmother of Ubud's raw food movement, Alchemy has been serving living-food cuisine since long before it was fashionable. The raw food bar lets you build custom salads and bowls, and the menu spans raw pizzas, zucchini pasta, sprouted grain dishes, and what might be Bali's best smoothie bowls. Everything is organic, and most produce comes from their own garden.

**Order this:** Build-Your-Own Raw Bowl, Chocolate Rawcake, Green Smoothie

### Moksa (Budget: $7-14)

Moksa grows most of its ingredients in an on-site permaculture garden, which means the menu changes with the seasons. The cooking is creative without being overwrought — tempeh steaks, jackfruit tacos, and fermented vegetables feature heavily. Regular cooking classes let you learn the techniques behind the food. The jungle garden setting is beautiful for a slow lunch.

**Order this:** Plant-Based Tasting Plate, Tempeh Steak, Kombucha Flight

### Earth Cafe (Budget: $5-12)

A more casual entry point to Ubud's plant-based scene, Earth Cafe serves hearty vegan and vegetarian comfort food at reasonable prices. Think big salads, grain bowls, fresh juices, and guilt-free desserts. The location on Ubud's main strip makes it a convenient stop between exploring temples and galleries.

**Order this:** Buddha Bowl, Vegan Nachos, Fresh Juice

## International & Fine Dining

### Room4Dessert (Budget: $60-120)

Pastry chef Will Goldfarb's dessert-focused restaurant is one of the most unique dining concepts in Asia. The multi-course dessert tasting menu — interspersed with savory courses — is theatrical, technically brilliant, and genuinely delicious. Each course is a miniature work of art that pushes the boundaries of what you think dessert can be. The open kitchen lets you watch the team work. This is a bucket-list experience.

**Order this:** The Full Tasting Menu

### Hujan Locale (Budget: $15-35)

Another Will Meyrick creation, Hujan Locale celebrates Indonesian cuisine through a contemporary lens. The cocktail program is outstanding — many drinks incorporate traditional Indonesian ingredients like jamu (herbal tonics), pandan, and various tropical fruits. The space is atmospheric, with vintage decor and warm lighting.

**Order this:** Slow-Cooked Lamb Shank, Beef Cheek Rendang, Jamu Cocktail

### Mozaic (Budget: $70-130)

Chef Chris Salans has been a pillar of Ubud's fine dining scene for over two decades. Mozaic's French-Indonesian tasting menu showcases his deep understanding of both cuisines, with dishes that feel neither forced nor derivative. The garden setting is romantic and intimate, making it perfect for special occasions. The wine pairing is well-curated and worth the upgrade.

**Order this:** Chef's Tasting Menu with Wine Pairing

## Cafes & Brunch

### Kismet (Budget: $6-15)

Kismet strikes the balance between wellness and indulgence better than most Ubud cafes. The menu mixes health-conscious options (turmeric lattes, grain bowls, cold-pressed juices) with more decadent choices (proper eggs benedict, fluffy pancakes). The coffee is excellent, the WiFi is reliable, and the two-story space gives you options for both social and focused seating.

**Order this:** Eggs Benedict, Turmeric Latte, Granola Bowl

### Seniman Coffee Studio (Budget: $3-10)

For serious coffee, Seniman is Ubud's best. They roast single-origin Indonesian beans on-site and the baristas can talk you through the differences between a Toraja, a Flores, and a Kintamani with genuine passion. The brewing methods range from V60 pour-over to cold drip, and the light food menu complements the coffee without trying to compete with it.

**Order this:** Single-Origin Pour-Over, Cold Brew, Toast with Local Honey

### Lazy Cats Cafe (Budget: $5-12)

A newcomer that quickly won over the Ubud crowd with its combination of excellent coffee, creative brunch dishes, and a laid-back atmosphere that doesn't try too hard. The space is filled with plants, natural light, and the kind of relaxed energy that makes you stay longer than planned.

**Order this:** Smashed Avo on Sourdough, Banana Pancakes, Iced Latte

## Restaurants with Stunning Views

Half the appeal of eating in Ubud is the setting. These restaurants offer food that's good enough to justify the visit on its own — with views that make it unforgettable.

### Sari Organik (Budget: $5-12)

Reached by a 15-minute walk through working rice terraces, Sari Organik is the definition of a destination restaurant. The menu is simple — organic salads, Indonesian staples, fresh juices — but eating surrounded by an unbroken panorama of rice paddies makes everything taste better. Go for a late lunch when the afternoon light turns everything gold.

### Swept Away at The Samaya (Budget: $30-60)

Fine dining in a bamboo pavilion suspended above the Ayung River gorge. The sound of the rushing river below, the jungle canopy at eye level, and the candlelit tables create an atmosphere that's hard to beat for romance. The food is refined Indonesian and Western, with an emphasis on fresh, local ingredients.

### Terrace at Bisma Eight (Budget: $10-25)

The rooftop restaurant at Bisma Eight hotel offers one of Ubud's best vantage points — a sweeping view of the jungle canopy and distant rice terraces. Come for sunset drinks and stay for dinner. The menu is contemporary Asian with solid execution across the board.

## Budget Tips for Eating in Ubud

Ubud is one of the most affordable food destinations in Bali if you eat where the locals eat.

**Under $3 per meal:** The warungs along Jalan Sukma and Jalan Gootama serve nasi campur, mie goreng, and gado-gado for 25,000-40,000 IDR. Ubud's central market also has cheap, excellent food stalls — go before noon for the best selection.

**$5-15 per meal:** The health-food cafes and mid-range restaurants offer enormous value, especially for the quality of ingredients (organic, locally sourced). Lunch specials bring prices down further.

**Splurge-worthy:** Ubud's fine dining restaurants offer world-class tasting menus at prices that would be two to three times higher in cities like Singapore, Tokyo, or Sydney. If you're going to splurge anywhere in Bali, the restaurants here deliver genuine value for the quality.

**General tips:**
- Eat babi guling for lunch, not dinner — the best spots sell out by early afternoon
- Ask your accommodation for their warung recommendations — staff always know the best local spots
- Many high-end restaurants close on certain days (usually Monday or Tuesday), so check ahead
- [Coffee plantation tours](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/) make an excellent pairing with a day of eating in Ubud

## Let Gede Plan Your Ubud Food Experience

Ubud's dining scene rewards local knowledge more than anywhere else in Bali. The best warungs don't advertise. The best fine dining restaurants need reservations weeks out. And the best food experiences — like a sunrise market tour followed by a [cooking class](/activities/cooking-classes/) — need someone who knows the right people. Gede can set up a food-focused itinerary that covers everything from $3 warungs to destination restaurants, timed perfectly to your trip.

Getting around Bali is simultaneously easy and complicated. The island is compact — you can drive from the airport to [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) in 90 minutes, or from [Canggu](/areas/canggu/) to [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/) in about an hour. But Bali has no rail system, no real public bus network, and roads that range from smooth coastal highways to potholed village lanes clogged with ceremony processions. Your transport choices shape your entire trip experience.

This guide covers every option, with real costs and honest assessments of when each one makes sense.

## Private Driver

A private driver is Bali's best-kept transport secret and the option most experienced visitors swear by. You get a dedicated, English-speaking driver with an air-conditioned car for a full day, and they take you wherever you want to go.

### How It Works

You agree on a pickup time and a rough itinerary (or just a list of places you want to visit), and the driver handles everything — navigation, parking, waiting while you explore, and suggesting stops you hadn't thought of. Good drivers double as informal guides, sharing local knowledge about temples, restaurants, and hidden spots.

### Cost

- **Full day (8-10 hours):** $40-55
- **Half day (4-5 hours):** $25-35
- **Airport transfer:** $15-25 depending on destination
- **Multi-day rates:** Often discounted to $35-45/day

Split between 2-4 passengers, this is often cheaper than ride-hailing apps for a full day of exploring — and incomparably more convenient.

### When to Use It

- **Day trips** — Visiting [temples](/activities/temple-tours/), [waterfalls](/activities/waterfall-tours/), rice terraces, or any combination of attractions across the island.
- **Airport transfers** — Especially late-night arrivals or early-morning departures.
- **Multi-area days** — Trips that cover distances like Canggu to Ubud to Uluwatu.
- **Groups** — A car for 4 people at $45/day is $11.25 per person for all-day transport.
- **When you don't ride scooters** — If you're not comfortable on a motorbike, a driver is the most practical daily transport for most itineraries.

### Booking a Driver

This is where quality varies enormously. Random drivers waiting at tourist spots may overcharge, take you to commission shops, or drive unsafely. [Book through Chill Bali Trips](/activities/private-driver/) and you get a vetted, reliable driver at a fair fixed rate with no hidden agenda.

## Scooter Rental

The most popular and cheapest way to get around Bali. Scooters are everywhere, and a rental gives you total freedom to explore on your own schedule.

### Cost

- **Daily rental:** $4-7 (IDR 60,000-100,000)
- **Weekly rental:** $25-40
- **Monthly rental:** $60-120
- **Fuel:** ~$0.80/liter, a full tank costs $2-3 and lasts several days

### Pros

- **Cheap:** By far the most economical transport option
- **Flexible:** Go anywhere, anytime, no waiting
- **Fast:** In traffic, scooters zip through gaps that cars can't
- **Fun:** Riding through rice paddies with the wind in your face is a genuine Bali experience
- **Parking:** Never a problem — you can park a scooter anywhere

### Cons (And Why You Need to Be Honest with Yourself)

- **Dangerous:** Bali's roads are chaotic. Cars, trucks, scooters, dogs, chickens, and ceremony processions share the same space. Potholes appear without warning. Rain makes surfaces slick. Accidents happen daily, and tourists are disproportionately affected.
- **No insurance coverage:** Most travel insurance policies exclude scooter injuries unless you hold a valid motorcycle license and are wearing a helmet. This is a serious financial risk.
- **Legal requirements:** Technically, you need an International Driving Permit (IDP) with a motorcycle endorsement to legally ride in Indonesia. Police sometimes set up checkpoints and fine riders without proper documents ($10-30 on-the-spot "fines").
- **Not for beginners:** If you've never ridden a scooter before, a busy Bali road is absolutely not the place to learn. This isn't being overcautious — it's being realistic about an environment where experienced riders have accidents.

### If You're Going to Ride

- **Always wear a helmet.** Non-negotiable.
- **Get an IDP before you leave home.** Available from your country's automobile association, usually $15-20.
- **Inspect the scooter before renting.** Photograph all existing damage. Test brakes, lights, and horn.
- **Don't ride at night in unfamiliar areas.** Road hazards you can dodge in daylight become invisible.
- **Don't drink and ride.** This should go without saying, but it's a common cause of serious tourist injuries in Bali.
- **Stay left.** Indonesia drives on the left side of the road.
- **Wear closed shoes.** Flip-flops offer zero protection.

## Ride-Hailing Apps (Grab and Gojek)

Grab and Gojek are the Uber equivalents in Southeast Asia and both operate extensively in Bali. They offer transparent, app-based pricing that eliminates negotiation and overcharging.

### Cost Examples

- **Short ride within [Canggu](/areas/canggu/):** $1-2
- **Canggu to [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/):** $2-4
- **Seminyak to Ubud:** $8-14
- **Airport to Canggu:** $8-12
- **Canggu to Uluwatu:** $10-16

Prices vary based on demand, time of day, and whether you choose a car (GrabCar/GoCar) or motorbike (GrabBike/GoRide — cheaper but you're on the back of someone else's scooter).

### Pros

- **Transparent pricing** — You see the fare before booking.
- **Payment options** — Cash or card (though cash is more reliable).
- **Track your ride** — GPS tracking for safety and navigation.
- **No negotiation** — The app sets the price.

### Limitations

- **Banned zones:** Some areas (parts of Ubud, around major temples, certain hotel entrances) restrict ride-hailing pickups. You may need to walk to a main road.
- **Availability varies:** In [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/), [Lovina](/areas/lovina/), and East Bali, drivers are scarce. In Canggu and Seminyak, they're plentiful.
- **Surge pricing:** During rain, peak hours, or New Year's Eve, prices can double or triple.
- **Connection issues:** The apps require a local SIM card or stable WiFi. Get a local SIM at the airport.

### Tips

- **Always choose cash payment.** Card payments occasionally fail, and some drivers prefer cash.
- **Check the license plate matches** the app before getting in.
- **Drop a pin carefully** on the map — Bali addresses can be confusing, and drivers navigate by GPS pin, not address.
- **GrabBike/GoRide** is faster and cheaper for solo travelers on short trips, but you're fully exposed to traffic on the back of a motorbike.

## Taxis

Traditional metered taxis still operate in Bali, though ride-hailing apps have largely replaced them for most travelers.

### Blue Bird Taxis

Blue Bird is the only taxi company worth using in Bali. They use meters, their cars are clean, and the drivers are professional. Look for the light blue cars with the bird logo.

**Base fare:** IDR 7,500 (~$0.50)
**Per kilometer:** IDR 6,500 (~$0.42)

A 20-minute ride typically costs $3-6.

### Warning: Fake Blue Birds

Imitator taxis paint their cars similar shades of blue to mimic Blue Bird. Check for the actual Blue Bird logo, the company name on the door, and a functioning meter. When in doubt, use the official My Blue Bird app to hail one.

### Non-Blue Bird Taxis

Avoid them. Meters that run fast, "broken" meters leading to inflated flat-rate quotes, and roundabout routes to increase fares are common complaints. There's no reason to use these when Blue Bird, Grab, and Gojek exist.

## Airport Transport

Getting from Ngurah Rai International Airport to your accommodation is every visitor's first transport decision.

### Options

| Option | Cost to Seminyak | Cost to Canggu | Cost to Ubud |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-arranged pickup | $12-18 | $15-22 | $20-30 |
| Official airport taxi | $12-15 | $15-20 | $20-25 |
| Grab/Gojek | $6-10 | $8-12 | $12-18 |
| Unofficial taxi touts | $25-50 (avoid) | $30-50 (avoid) | $40-60 (avoid) |

**Best option:** Pre-arrange a pickup through your hotel or through Chill Bali Trips. Your driver meets you at arrivals with a sign, helps with bags, and drives you directly to your accommodation. After a long flight, this convenience is worth every cent.

**Budget option:** Walk past the taxi touts to the designated Grab/Gojek pickup area outside the terminal. Follow the signs — it's about a 5-minute walk from arrivals.

## Shuttle Buses

Shared shuttle buses connect Bali's main tourist hubs on fixed routes and schedules.

### Perama Shuttle

The longest-running tourist shuttle service in Bali. Perama connects major hubs including Kuta, Sanur, Ubud, [Lovina](/areas/lovina/), and Padang Bai (for ferries to Lombok and the Gilis).

**Sample prices:**
- Kuta to Ubud: $5-8
- Kuta to Lovina: $12-15
- Kuta to Padang Bai: $8-10

**Pros:** Cheap, air-conditioned, scheduled departures.
**Cons:** Fixed schedules (often only 1-2 departures per day), slow (stops at multiple pickup points), doesn't cover all areas (notably absent from Canggu and Uluwatu).

### Kura-Kura Bus

A tourist shuttle service with fixed routes connecting major areas in southern Bali (Kuta, Seminyak, Sanur, Jimbaran, Nusa Dua, and DFS Galleria). Air-conditioned, affordable, but limited routes and infrequent service.

### When Shuttles Make Sense

For solo budget travelers making point-to-point transfers between major hubs (e.g., the coast to Ubud, or down to Padang Bai for a boat). For any other situation — day trips, exploring, or groups of 2+ people — a private driver offers dramatically better value and flexibility.

## Boats and Ferries

Getting between Bali and the surrounding islands requires sea transport.

### Fast Boats

- **Bali to Nusa Penida:** 30-45 minutes from Sanur. $15-25 return. Multiple operators, varying quality. Book through a reputable operator to avoid overcrowded or poorly maintained boats.
- **Bali to Nusa Lembongan:** 30 minutes from Sanur. Similar pricing.
- **Bali to Gili Islands:** 2-2.5 hours from Padang Bai or Serangan. $30-50 one way.
- **Bali to Lombok:** 2-2.5 hours by fast boat, or 4-5 hours by public ferry from Padang Bai ($5).

For [Nusa Penida day trips](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/), Chill Bali Trips arranges the boats, transfers, and island transport as a complete package.

### Safety Note

Not all boat operators maintain the same safety standards. Choose operators with good reviews, life jackets on board, and boats that don't appear overloaded. This is not an area to bargain-hunt — the cheapest fast boat ticket is often the cheapest for a reason.

## Cycling

Bali is not particularly bike-friendly for transport (the traffic and road conditions are challenging), but cycling works well in specific contexts:

- **Within Ubud:** The central area is compact enough that cycling works for getting between shops, restaurants, and nearby rice fields.
- **[Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) and surrounds:** Flat terrain and quieter roads make cycling viable for local errands and rice field exploration.
- **Guided [cycling tours](/activities/cycling-tours/):** Downhill routes from Kintamani to Ubud are one of Bali's best activities — scenic, fun, and mostly effortless.

Rental bikes (not motorized) cost about $3-5 per day from shops in tourist areas.

## Walking

Walking is practical only within specific neighborhoods:

- **Central Ubud:** Walkable core with shops, restaurants, and the Monkey Forest
- **Batu Bolong area of Canggu:** The main strip is walkable
- **Seminyak main strip:** Jalan Kayu Aya and surrounds
- **Sanur boardwalk:** A pleasant beachfront path stretching several kilometers

Beyond these zones, sidewalks are unreliable (broken, blocked, or nonexistent), and the combination of traffic and tropical heat makes walking impractical for anything more than short distances.

## Transport Strategy by Trip Type

### Solo Backpacker
Scooter rental (if experienced) + Grab/GoRide for nights out. Budget: $5-10/day.

### Couple on Holiday
Mix of Grab/GoCar for short hops + private driver for day trips. Budget: $15-25/day.

### Family with Kids
Private driver for day trips + Grab for around-town. Scooters are not suitable for families. Budget: $25-45/day.

### Group of Friends (3-4 people)
Private driver every day — it's the best value at this group size. Budget: $10-15/person/day.

### Digital Nomad (1+ months)
Monthly scooter rental + occasional Grab. Budget: $4-7/day.

## Practical Tips

- **Google Maps works well** in Bali for navigation and real-time traffic. Download offline maps in case of connectivity issues.
- **Traffic is worst** on the Canggu-Seminyak corridor (5-7 PM), around Kuta-Legian (all day), and the road from Denpasar to Ubud (mornings and evenings).
- **Ceremony traffic** can close roads without warning. When a Balinese ceremony procession is moving through, you wait. This is not optional and not negotiable — and it's one of the things that makes Bali special.
- **Fuel up at Pertamina stations** for reliable, fair-priced fuel. Roadside bottles of fuel (the colored liquid in vodka bottles) work in a pinch but charge roughly double.
- **Parking is usually free or very cheap** ($0.10-0.30 for scooters, $0.30-0.60 for cars at most destinations).
- **Download both Grab and Gojek** — sometimes one has drivers available when the other doesn't.

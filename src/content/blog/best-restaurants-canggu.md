Canggu has undergone a culinary transformation over the past few years. What was once a quiet stretch of rice paddies and surf breaks between [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) and Tanah Lot has become one of Bali's most dynamic food neighborhoods — a sprawling, slightly chaotic mix of surf shacks, specialty coffee roasters, Instagram-famous brunch spots, authentic warungs, and increasingly ambitious restaurants.

The result is a dining scene that's broad, affordable, and genuinely exciting, even if it sometimes feels like every second building is a new cafe. The trick to eating well in [Canggu](/areas/canggu/) is knowing which spots deliver substance behind the style — and which hidden warungs are serving food that outperforms restaurants charging five times the price.

This guide breaks it all down by cuisine and budget, with a focus on the places that have earned their reputations through consistent quality rather than social media hype.

## Indonesian & Balinese Cuisine

### Warung Dandelion (Budget: $2-5)

Warung Dandelion is the kind of place you stumble into once and then eat at every day for the rest of your trip. Run by a Balinese family, it serves simple, honest Indonesian food at local prices — nasi campur, ayam betutu, sate lilit, and the kind of sambal that makes you reconsider every other sambal you've ever had. The space is small and unassuming, which is exactly how you know the food is the priority.

**Order this:** Nasi Campur, Ayam Betutu, Extra Sambal

### Warung Local (Budget: $3-6)

Don't let the slightly polished exterior fool you — Warung Local serves genuinely traditional Balinese food at near-warung prices. The menu is more extensive than most local spots, covering dishes from across the Indonesian archipelago. The rendang is slow-cooked properly (not the rushed version you get at tourist restaurants), and the gado-gado uses a peanut sauce recipe that's been passed down through generations.

**Order this:** Beef Rendang, Gado-Gado, Nasi Goreng Kampung

### Fishbone Local (Budget: $8-18)

Fishbone Local bridges the gap between warung and restaurant — the food is elevated and the setting is comfortable, but prices stay reasonable. The grilled seafood is the main draw, with fish, prawns, and squid sourced from Jimbaran market that morning. The Balinese spice rubs and sambal selection transform simple grilled protein into something memorable.

**Order this:** Grilled Fish with Sambal Matah, Prawn Satay, Tuna Tartare

## Brunch & Cafes

Canggu is arguably the brunch capital of Bali. The cafe culture here is deeply embedded, driven by a population of digital nomads, surfers, and wellness seekers who take their morning coffee and smoothie bowls very seriously.

### Crate Cafe (Budget: $6-14)

The godfather of Canggu brunch culture, Crate has been serving strong coffee and inventive breakfast dishes since before Canggu was Canggu. The space is raw and industrial — concrete floors, exposed brick, communal tables — and the food matches the aesthetic: no-nonsense, generous, and consistently good. The line on weekends tells you everything you need to know.

**Order this:** Big Breakfast, Shakshuka, Cold Brew on Tap

### The Slow (Budget: $8-18)

The Slow is more than a cafe — it's a boutique hotel, gallery, and restaurant wrapped into one beautifully designed space. The food leans Mediterranean-Australian with strong local influences. The fried chicken sandwich has developed a cult following, and the coffee program is one of the most serious in Canggu. Come for brunch, stay for the atmosphere.

**Order this:** Fried Chicken Sandwich, Acai Bowl, Specialty Coffee

### Nude (Budget: $6-14)

Nude leans heavily into the wellness-cafe model but executes it with more care than most. The smoothie bowls are works of art (and actually taste as good as they look), the cold-pressed juices use quality produce, and the grain bowls are substantial enough to fuel a day of exploring. The Berawa location has the best vibe, with an open-air terrace and lush greenery.

**Order this:** Dragon Fruit Smoothie Bowl, Green Goddess Bowl, Turmeric Latte

### Avocado Factory (Budget: $5-12)

Yes, the entire menu revolves around avocados. No, it's not a gimmick. The kitchen finds genuinely creative ways to showcase the fruit — avocado fries, avocado pasta, avocado brownies — alongside more conventional applications. The quality is high, the portions are generous, and the prices are fair for what you get. It's fun, unpretentious, and surprisingly satisfying.

**Order this:** Avocado Fries, Avo Toast Deluxe, Avocado Chocolate Mousse

## International Cuisine

### Ji Terrace by the Sea (Budget: $20-45)

Perched above a rugged stretch of coastline near Echo Beach, Ji Terrace serves elevated Japanese-Peruvian (Nikkei) cuisine with one of Canggu's most dramatic views. The sunset from the terrace is spectacular, and the food matches the setting — fresh ceviche, delicate sashimi, creative maki rolls, and robata-grilled meats. Book a terrace table for sunset and arrive 30 minutes early to enjoy the full light show.

**Order this:** Ceviche Mixto, Black Cod Miso, Tuna Tataki

### Mana Uluwatu at Pererenan (Budget: $10-25)

Despite the confusing name, this location near [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) serves some of the best Mexican food in Bali. The tacos use hand-pressed corn tortillas, the guacamole is made fresh tableside, and the mezcal selection is surprising for a tropical island. Tuesday taco nights are a local institution.

**Order this:** Al Pastor Tacos, Tableside Guacamole, Mezcal Margarita

### Hungry Bird (Budget: $5-12)

Hungry Bird is all about the coffee — some of the best specialty coffee in Canggu, with beans roasted in-house and baristas who know their way around a pour-over. The food menu is focused but excellent: quality sandwiches, grain bowls, and pastries that pair perfectly with a slow morning. The garden seating is lovely.

**Order this:** V60 Pour-Over, Chicken Sandwich, Banana Bread

### La Baracca (Budget: $10-22)

Authentic Italian cooking in the heart of Canggu, run by actual Italians who take their pizza and pasta seriously. The wood-fired pizzas have properly charred, blistered crusts, the pasta is made fresh, and the burrata is flown in weekly. It's the kind of Italian restaurant that doesn't need to shout about authenticity because you can taste it in every bite.

**Order this:** Margherita Pizza, Cacio e Pepe, Burrata with Prosciutto

### Shady Shack (Budget: $5-12)

A Canggu institution for plant-based eating, Shady Shack serves creative vegetarian and vegan food in a charming, plant-filled garden setting. The menu is extensive — from jackfruit tacos to halloumi burgers to mushroom "steaks" — and almost everything works. The vibe is relaxed and inclusive, and the prices are friendly enough for daily visits.

**Order this:** Halloumi Burger, Nasi Goreng Bowl, Raw Snickers Bar

## Seafood & Beach Dining

### Echo Beach Club (Budget: $12-30)

Sitting right on Echo Beach, this is one of the best spots in Canggu for combining food with a surf-watching session. The seafood platter is generous and fresh, the beer is cold, and the atmosphere is perfectly laid-back. Come for a late lunch after a morning surf session and watch the sunset roll in.

**Order this:** Seafood Platter, Grilled Prawns, Cold Bintang

### Old Man's (Budget: $6-18)

Old Man's isn't really about the food — it's about the vibe. But the kitchen holds its own with solid pub-style fare: burgers, wings, fish and chips, and cold beers. The real draw is the atmosphere: live music, pool tables, cheap drinks, and one of Canggu's most social scenes. Come for dinner, stay for the party.

**Order this:** Classic Burger, Chicken Wings, Bucket of Bintang

### The Lawn (Budget: $12-28)

Beanbags on the grass overlooking Batu Bolong Beach — The Lawn has one of Canggu's most laid-back settings. The food is better than the beachy vibe might suggest, with quality wood-fired pizzas, fresh salads, and a solid cocktail list. It's particularly good at sunset when the light turns everything golden and the surf rolls in below.

**Order this:** Wood-Fired Pizza, Fish Tacos, Sunset Cocktail

## Fine Dining & Special Occasions

### Mason (Budget: $25-55)

Mason brought a level of culinary ambition to Canggu that didn't exist before. The tasting menu showcases modern Australian-Asian cooking with an emphasis on local produce and Indonesian flavors. The wine list is thoughtfully curated, the cocktails are creative, and the service strikes the right balance between attentive and relaxed.

**Order this:** Chef's Tasting Menu, Cocktail Pairing

### Milk & Madu (Budget: $10-25)

Occupying a beautifully restored heritage building, Milk & Madu serves elevated comfort food in one of Canggu's most charming settings. The sourdough program is excellent (they bake in-house), the brunch menu is comprehensive, and dinner brings more ambitious plates. It's a reliable choice for any meal of the day.

**Order this:** Sourdough Toast with Seasonal Toppings, Slow-Cooked Lamb Shoulder, House-Made Pasta

## Budget Tips for Eating in Canggu

Canggu's dual identity as both a local Balinese village and an international digital-nomad hub means the price range is enormous. You can eat well for $3 or $30 — and sometimes the $3 meal is better.

**Under $5 per meal:** The warungs along Jalan Pantai Berawa and the smaller roads off the main Canggu shortcuts serve excellent Indonesian food at local prices. Look for places where the staff eat — that's always a reliable indicator.

**$5-15 per meal:** The cafes and mid-range restaurants offer outstanding value, especially at brunch. Most serve portions designed for hungry surfers, so you're getting serious volume alongside quality.

**Splurge-worthy:** Canggu's fine dining scene is still developing, but the top-end options deliver impressive quality at prices well below what you'd pay in Seminyak for equivalent food.

**General tips:**
- The best warungs often close by 3 PM — eat your Indonesian food at lunch
- Sunset dining at beachfront spots is popular — arrive by 4:30 PM to claim good seats without a reservation
- Many Canggu restaurants are clustered along specific roads (Batu Bolong, Berawa, Echo Beach) — plan your meals geographically to avoid excessive scooter time
- Combine a food day with a [surfing lesson](/activities/surfing-lessons/) at Batu Bolong for the full Canggu experience

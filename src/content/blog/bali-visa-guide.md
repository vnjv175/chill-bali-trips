Indonesia's visa system has changed significantly in recent years, and the information online ranges from outdated to outright wrong. This guide covers exactly what you need to know about entering Bali in 2026 — the visa types available, who qualifies for what, current costs, and how extensions work.

**Important disclaimer:** Visa regulations can change with little notice. This guide reflects the rules as of early 2026. Always verify current requirements with the Indonesian Embassy in your country or a trusted visa agent before traveling.

## Quick Reference: Which Visa Do You Need?

| Situation | Visa Type | Max Stay | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Short holiday (under 30 days) | Visa on Arrival (VOA) | 30 days | $35 |
| Holiday up to 60 days | VOA + extension | 60 days | $35 + ~$35 extension |
| Applied online before arrival | e-VOA | 30 days (extendable to 60) | $35 |
| Longer stay (60+ days) | B211A Social/Cultural Visa | 60 days (extendable to 180) | $150-300 through agent |
| Remote work / digital nomad | E33G Digital Nomad Visa | Up to 1 year | ~$250-350 |
| ASEAN passport holders | Visa-free entry | 30 days | Free |

## Visa on Arrival (VOA)

The Visa on Arrival is the standard entry method for most tourists visiting Bali. It's straightforward, available at the airport, and covers stays of up to 30 days with the option to extend for another 30.

### Who Qualifies

Citizens of over 90 countries qualify for VOA, including:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Canada
- All EU/EEA countries
- New Zealand
- Japan
- South Korea
- Brazil
- South Africa
- Most other Western and developed nations

The full list is available on the Indonesian immigration website. If your country isn't on the list, you'll need to apply for a visa at an Indonesian embassy before travel.

### How It Works

1. **At the airport:** After landing at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali, follow signs to the VOA payment counter (before immigration).
2. **Pay the fee:** $35 USD, payable in cash (USD, IDR, or other major currencies) or by credit/debit card.
3. **Proceed to immigration:** Present your passport (must be valid for at least 6 months from arrival date), completed arrival card, and VOA receipt.
4. **Get stamped:** Immigration stamps your passport with a 30-day VOA.

The entire process typically takes 15-30 minutes, depending on queue length. Peak arrival times (multiple international flights landing around 9-11 PM) can push this to an hour.

### Requirements

- Passport valid for at least 6 months from date of entry
- Return or onward ticket (immigration may ask to see this)
- $35 visa fee
- Proof of accommodation (rarely checked but good to have)

## e-VOA (Electronic Visa on Arrival)

The e-VOA is the online version of the same visa. You apply and pay before you arrive, which means you skip the VOA payment counter at the airport and go directly to immigration.

### Why Use e-VOA Instead of Regular VOA

- **Faster airport processing:** Skip the payment queue entirely.
- **Pay in advance:** No need to carry cash for the visa fee.
- **Same terms:** 30 days, extendable to 60, same price ($35).

### How to Apply

1. Visit the official Indonesian immigration e-VOA portal (molina.imigrasi.go.id)
2. Create an account and fill in the application form
3. Upload a passport photo and passport bio page scan
4. Pay $35 online
5. Receive your e-VOA approval via email

**Apply at least 48 hours before travel** to allow processing time. Most approvals come through within 24 hours.

**Warning:** Use only the official government portal. Several third-party websites charge $50-80 for the same e-VOA and simply submit the application on your behalf through the government site.

## Extending Your VOA

If 30 days isn't enough, you can extend your VOA (or e-VOA) for one additional 30-day period, giving you a total of 60 days in Bali.

### How to Extend

The extension must be started **before your initial 30 days expire** — ideally 7-10 days before.

**Option 1: DIY at the immigration office**

Visit the nearest immigration office (Ngurah Rai or Denpasar), bring your passport, a photocopy of your passport bio page and current visa stamp, a passport photo, and the extension fee (~$35). The process requires 2-3 visits over about a week and involves waiting in lines.

**Option 2: Use a visa agent**

This is what most people do. A visa agent handles the entire process for you — they take your passport, manage the immigration office visits, and return your passport with the extension stamp. Cost through an agent is typically $50-70 (including the official fee and their service charge).

Gede can recommend trusted visa agents who handle extensions smoothly and return your passport within a few business days.

## Visa-Free Entry

Citizens of ASEAN countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, etc.) can enter Indonesia visa-free for stays up to 30 days. This visa-free entry is **not extendable** — if you want to stay longer than 30 days, opt for the paid VOA at arrival instead so you can extend.

A limited number of other countries also qualify for visa-free entry under specific bilateral agreements. Check the current list before relying on this option.

## B211A Social/Cultural Visa

For stays longer than 60 days, the B211A is the standard option. This visa allows an initial stay of 60 days, extendable up to a total of 180 days (six months) through successive 60-day extensions.

### Who Uses It

- Long-term travelers exploring Indonesia
- People studying Balinese culture, language, or arts
- Yoga teacher training participants
- Anyone needing more than 60 days
- Digital nomads (before the specific nomad visa was introduced)

### How to Get It

The B211A requires a sponsor in Indonesia — either an individual Indonesian citizen or a registered visa agent/company.

**Through a visa agent (recommended):**
1. Contact a reputable visa agent in Bali (ask Gede for recommendations)
2. Provide passport copies, photos, and flight details
3. The agent handles the sponsorship and application
4. You receive an e-visa approval before traveling or upon arrival
5. **Cost:** $150-300 depending on the agent and whether you apply from abroad or within Indonesia

### Extensions

Each 60-day extension of the B211A costs approximately $50-80 through an agent. You can extend up to a total stay of 180 days. After 180 days, you'll need to leave Indonesia (a visa run to Singapore or Kuala Lumpur is the common approach) and apply for a new visa.

### Important Notes

- The B211A is technically a social/cultural visa, not a work visa. It does not authorize paid employment in Indonesia.
- Immigration sometimes asks about the purpose of your visit. "Studying Balinese culture" or "learning Indonesian" are standard acceptable answers.
- You must exit Indonesia before the visa expires or face overstay penalties.

## E33G Digital Nomad Visa (Remote Worker Visa)

Indonesia introduced the Digital Nomad Visa to formally accommodate the large community of remote workers based in Bali. This visa allows you to live in Bali while working remotely for employers or clients outside Indonesia.

### Key Features

- **Duration:** Up to 1 year (12 months), renewable
- **Work authorization:** Legally work remotely for non-Indonesian employers/clients
- **Tax status:** Income earned from foreign sources is not taxed in Indonesia under this visa category (verify current tax regulations, as policies evolve)

### Requirements

- Proof of remote employment or freelance work with non-Indonesian clients
- Minimum monthly income threshold (approximately $2,000-2,500/month — verify current requirement)
- Health insurance valid in Indonesia
- Clean criminal record
- Passport valid for at least 18 months

### How to Apply

The application is submitted through the Indonesian immigration portal or through a visa agent. Processing typically takes 2-4 weeks.

**Cost:** Approximately $250-350 for the visa application, plus agent fees if using one.

### Is It Worth It?

For digital nomads planning to stay 6+ months, the Digital Nomad Visa provides legal peace of mind and avoids the hassle of visa runs and extensions. For shorter stays (under 6 months), the B211A may be simpler and cheaper.

## Overstay Penalties

Overstaying your visa in Indonesia carries serious consequences:

- **Daily fine:** IDR 1,000,000 per day (approximately $65/day)
- **Maximum overstay:** 60 days — after which you face detention and deportation
- **Immigration blacklist:** Serious overstays can result in a ban on re-entering Indonesia

Do not overstay your visa. Set calendar reminders, track your dates, and begin the extension process well before expiry.

## Passport Requirements

Regardless of visa type, your passport must be:

- Valid for at least **6 months** from your date of entry (18 months for the Digital Nomad Visa)
- In good condition — damaged passports can be refused at immigration
- Have at least **2-3 blank pages** for stamps

If your passport is close to expiring, renew it before traveling. Indonesian immigration is strict about the 6-month validity requirement.

## Arrival Tips

### Customs Declaration

You'll fill out a customs declaration (usually digital via the Indonesian e-CD app) before arrival. Standard duty-free allowances include:

- 200 cigarettes or 25 cigars or 100g tobacco
- 1 liter of alcohol
- Goods valued up to $500

### Prohibited Items

Indonesia has strict drug laws — possession of drugs carries severe penalties, including the death penalty for trafficking. Don't bring any controlled substances into the country.

Fresh fruit, plants, and certain food products are also restricted. Declare anything you're unsure about.

### Airport Process

The typical arrival sequence at Ngurah Rai airport:

1. Download and complete the e-CD (customs declaration) before landing
2. VOA payment counter (skip if you have e-VOA)
3. Immigration — passport check and stamp
4. Baggage claim
5. Customs — usually a quick walk-through unless flagged
6. Exit to arrivals hall

**Total time from landing to exit:** 30-90 minutes depending on queues.

## Practical Tips

- **Photocopy everything.** Keep digital copies of your passport bio page, visa stamps, and travel insurance on your phone and in cloud storage.
- **Track your dates.** Know exactly when your visa expires and when you need to start the extension process.
- **Use a reputable agent.** For B211A visas and extensions, a good agent is worth the fee. Bad agents lose passports and miss deadlines.
- **Don't work on a tourist visa.** While enforcement is imperfect, working on a VOA or visa-free entry is technically illegal and can result in deportation if caught. The Digital Nomad Visa exists for this purpose.
- **Keep your passport safe.** Use your hotel safe and carry a photocopy or phone photo for daily identification.

Bali is one of the safest destinations in Southeast Asia, and the overwhelming majority of Balinese people are genuinely kind, honest, and welcoming. That said, the island's massive tourism industry attracts a small minority of opportunists who target visitors unfamiliar with local norms and pricing. Knowing what to watch for eliminates most of the risk.

This guide covers 22 specific scams and tourist traps you might encounter in Bali, how each one works, and exactly how to avoid them.

## Money and Currency Scams

### 1. Money Changer Short-Changing

**How it works:** Unauthorized money changers (often in small shops with "Best Rate" signs) offer exchange rates that look too good to be true. During the counting process, they use sleight-of-hand to remove bills, fold notes to hide them, or "recount" and pocket the difference. Some use rigged calculators that show incorrect totals.

**How to avoid it:** Only exchange money at authorized money changers with clear signage and a reputation (Central Kuta Money Exchange, BMC, and PT. Dirgahayu are reliable chains). Better yet, withdraw from bank-branch ATMs (BCA, Mandiri, BRI) and skip the exchange altogether.

### 2. ATM Skimming

**How it works:** Card skimming devices are attached to ATM card slots to capture your card data. Hidden cameras record your PIN. Standalone ATMs in tourist areas are the most common targets.

**How to avoid it:** Use ATMs inside bank branches (BCA, Mandiri, BRI, CIMB). Check the card slot for anything loose or unusual before inserting your card. Cover the keypad when entering your PIN. Set up transaction notifications on your banking app so you catch unauthorized charges immediately.

### 3. Broken Bill Scam

**How it works:** When paying at a shop or for a service, the vendor claims your bill is torn, fake, or damaged and won't accept it. They swap your good bill for an actually damaged one and demand a replacement. You end up paying twice.

**How to avoid it:** Pay attention when handing over money. If someone claims a bill is damaged, take it back and inspect it yourself. Carry small denominations so you're not handing over large bills that are easier to swap.

## Transport Scams

### 4. Airport Taxi Mafia

**How it works:** Upon exiting the airport arrivals hall, you'll be swarmed by unofficial taxi drivers quoting inflated prices — often $30-50 for rides that should cost $10-15. They're persistent and sometimes intimidating.

**How to avoid it:** Book an airport pickup in advance through your hotel or through Chill Bali Trips. Alternatively, walk to the official taxi counter inside the arrivals hall and use a metered taxi (Blue Bird is the reliable brand). Or walk past the taxi touts to the designated Grab/Gojek pickup area.

### 5. Unmetered Taxis

**How it works:** Non-Blue Bird taxis may "forget" to start the meter or claim it's broken, then charge a heavily inflated flat rate at the end of the ride.

**How to avoid it:** Use Blue Bird taxis (the light blue ones with the bird logo — watch for imitations in similar colors). Insist the meter is running before the car moves. Better yet, use Grab or Gojek for transparent, app-based pricing.

### 6. Inflated Private Driver Rates

**How it works:** Drivers at tourist spots or hotels offer day rates of $80-100+ for services that typically cost $40-55. They know you're captive and unlikely to comparison-shop on the spot.

**How to avoid it:** Arrange your [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) in advance through a reputable service. Chill Bali Trips charges fair, fixed rates and vets all drivers.

### 7. Fuel Scam at Petrol Stations

**How it works:** Some petrol stations reset the pump partway through fueling your scooter, effectively charging you for fuel you didn't receive. Others use pumps that run fast but dispense slowly.

**How to avoid it:** Watch the pump display reset to zero before fueling starts. Fuel at official Pertamina stations rather than roadside bottle sellers (the bottles with colored fuel you'll see everywhere). The roadside bottles charge double the station price.

## Activity and Tour Scams

### 8. Overpriced Tour Packages from Street Touts

**How it works:** Street touts at tourist hubs sell "exclusive" tour packages at 2-3x the normal price, often for the same standard tours available through any operator. They may promise private tours that turn out to be shared groups.

**How to avoid it:** Book activities through a trusted operator like Chill Bali Trips rather than random touts on the street. Compare prices online before committing. If a deal seems unusually cheap, there's probably a catch (rushed itinerary, hidden fees, commission-driven stops at overpriced shops).

### 9. Temple "Guide" Scam

**How it works:** At temples like Besakih (the Mother Temple), unofficial "guides" approach claiming you need a guide or special entry permit to enter. They charge $20-50 for "guiding" that's often just walking ahead of you and pointing at things. Some block the entrance until you agree.

**How to avoid it:** You don't need a guide at most temples. Official entry fees are posted at the ticket counter. If you want a genuine cultural guide, arrange one in advance through Chill Bali Trips' [temple tours](/activities/temple-tours/). At Besakih specifically, walking confidently past the touts and going directly to the ticket counter is the move.

### 10. Bali Swing Bait-and-Switch

**How it works:** Cheap [Bali Swing](/activities/bali-swing/) packages are advertised online ($10-15) but the actual experience is at a run-down or different location than pictured. Alternatively, the base price covers one swing, but you're pressured to pay extra for the photo spots, better swings, and other add-ons.

**How to avoid it:** Book the original and reputable Bali Swing experiences. Read recent reviews. Ask what's included before paying.

### 11. Commission-Driven Shopping Stops

**How it works:** Drivers on tour packages make "bonus" stops at jewelry shops, art galleries, or clothing stores where they earn commission on your purchases. These shops charge inflated prices to cover the driver's cut. Some tours include 2-3 mandatory shopping stops.

**How to avoid it:** When booking a tour or driver, explicitly ask about shopping stops. A good driver won't force you into shops. [Chill Bali Trips' drivers](/activities/private-driver/) are paid fairly and don't rely on commission stops.

## Street and Beach Scams

### 12. Beach Vendor Harassment

**How it works:** Vendors on popular beaches (Kuta, Legian, Seminyak) can be extremely persistent — following you, placing items on your towel, or starting massages and nail treatments without clear consent, then demanding payment.

**How to avoid it:** A firm but polite "no, terima kasih" (no, thank you) is usually sufficient. If someone places something on your towel, don't touch it — touching can be construed as acceptance. For beach massages, agree on the exact price and service before anything starts.

### 13. Broken Surfboard/Scooter Damage Scam

**How it works:** You rent a surfboard or scooter, and when you return it, the rental operator claims you caused damage that was already there. They demand payment for "repairs" — sometimes $50-200.

**How to avoid it:** Photograph the board or scooter from every angle before taking it, including any existing scratches and dents. Show the photos to the rental operator and have them acknowledge the pre-existing condition. For scooters specifically, photograph the body panels, mirrors, and any marks.

### 14. Fake Police

**How it works:** Individuals posing as police officers (or actual police in some cases) stop you on a scooter, claim a minor traffic violation, and demand an on-the-spot "fine" — usually $10-50. They may confiscate your license until you pay.

**How to avoid it:** Carry a copy (photo on your phone is fine) of your passport and any required international driving permit (IDP). If stopped, ask to see their identification. Real fines are processed at a police station, not on the roadside. If you're riding with a valid IDP and helmet, you're less likely to be targeted. Staying calm and polite goes a long way.

### 15. Motorbike Bag Snatching

**How it works:** Thieves on motorbikes grab bags, phones, or cameras from pedestrians or passengers on the back of scooters. This happens most often in busy tourist areas at night.

**How to avoid it:** Carry bags on the traffic-side shoulder (away from the road) or use a cross-body bag. Don't walk while looking at your phone. When riding pillion on a scooter, keep your bag between you and the driver, not hanging on the outside.

## Accommodation Scams

### 16. Fake Listings

**How it works:** Attractive villa or hotel listings on booking platforms use stolen photos from other properties. When you arrive, the actual accommodation is significantly different from what was advertised, or in some cases doesn't exist at all.

**How to avoid it:** Book through reputable platforms (Booking.com, Agoda, Airbnb) that offer verified reviews and dispute protection. Cross-reference listing photos with Google Maps street view. For direct villa bookings, ask for a video tour before paying.

### 17. Hidden Fees at Hotels

**How it works:** Hotels advertise low rates but add significant charges at checkout — resort fees, "government tax," mandatory breakfast charges, or WiFi fees that weren't disclosed at booking.

**How to avoid it:** Read the fine print before booking. Use platforms that show all-inclusive pricing. Ask the property directly about additional charges before confirming your reservation.

## Shopping Scams

### 18. Fake Branded Goods at Market Prices

**How it works:** Markets sell convincing counterfeit designer goods, electronics, and branded items. While buying knockoff sunglasses is a personal choice, some vendors sell fake electronics (memory cards, chargers, headphones) that don't work or can damage your devices.

**How to avoid it:** If it looks like a $200 product being sold for $15, it's not real. For electronics, buy from established stores (Miniso, official brand stores) rather than market stalls.

### 19. Art Gallery Pressure Sales

**How it works:** "Art students" invite you to their "gallery" or "exhibition," then use high-pressure sales tactics and emotional appeals to sell overpriced paintings. The artwork is mass-produced, not original.

**How to avoid it:** Politely decline invitations from strangers to visit galleries. If you want authentic Balinese art, visit established galleries in Ubud with published artists and fixed prices.

### 20. Spice and Coffee Markup

**How it works:** Tourist-oriented spice and coffee shops in market areas charge 5-10x the local price for basic products. "Premium" Luwak coffee is often fake or mixed with regular beans.

**How to avoid it:** Buy spices and coffee at local supermarkets (Pepito, Bintang, Coco Supermarket) for genuine products at fair prices. For authentic [coffee plantation experiences](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/), book through a reputable operator.

## Health and Safety Scams

### 21. Fake Alcohol (Arak Poisoning)

**How it works:** This is the most serious item on the list. Cheap cocktails and local spirits in some bars and shops may contain methanol — a dangerous alcohol substitute that can cause blindness, organ damage, or death. This is not technically a "scam" but a genuine safety risk that has killed tourists in Bali.

**How to avoid it:** Drink at established, reputable bars and restaurants. Be cautious with extremely cheap cocktails, especially at no-name bars. Avoid purchasing local arak from unlabeled bottles. If a drink tastes unusually harsh or chemical, stop drinking it. Symptoms of methanol poisoning include blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, and confusion — seek medical attention immediately.

### 22. Overcharging at Clinics

**How it works:** Some private medical clinics charge dramatically inflated rates for basic treatments when they realize you're a tourist — sometimes $200-500 for consultations and treatments that should cost $20-50.

**How to avoid it:** For non-emergencies, use BIMC or Siloam hospitals — they're international-standard with transparent pricing. Carry travel insurance (always) and contact your insurer before accepting expensive treatment. For minor issues (stomach bugs, cuts, mild illness), pharmacies in Bali are well-stocked and pharmacists can advise on basic treatments.

## General Safety Tips

Bali is genuinely safe. Violent crime against tourists is rare. The items on this list are predominantly minor financial annoyances rather than serious threats. To stay safe and avoid hassles:

- **Use a trusted local contact.** Having someone like Gede from Chill Bali Trips means you have a vetted recommendation for every service, from drivers to restaurants to money changers.
- **Trust your instincts.** If a price seems too good or a situation feels off, walk away.
- **Carry travel insurance.** Always. No exceptions.
- **Keep copies of important documents.** Photo your passport, visa, and insurance card on your phone.
- **Respect local customs.** Travelers who show respect for Balinese culture, dress modestly at temples, and engage politely are far less likely to be targeted by anyone.
- **Stay aware of your surroundings.** Basic street-smart behavior applies here just as it does in any tourist destination worldwide.

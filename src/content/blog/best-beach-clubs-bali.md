Bali's beach club scene has become legendary, and for good reason. Where else can you lounge on a daybed above the Indian Ocean, swim in an infinity pool overlooking a volcanic coastline, eat restaurant-quality food, drink craft cocktails, and watch a world-class DJ play as the sun drops below the horizon — all in a single afternoon?

The range is enormous. You can find everything from barefoot, sand-between-your-toes chill spots where the most strenuous activity is turning over on your sunbed, to full-blown mega-clubs carved into cliffsides where international headliners play until dawn. Prices vary just as widely — from free entry with reasonable food and drink, to $200+ minimum-spend daybeds at the premium venues.

This guide covers the best beach clubs across every area and vibe, so you can find the right spot whether you're looking for a quiet afternoon with a book and a cocktail or a sunset-to-sunrise party session.

## The Iconic Beach Clubs

### Potato Head Beach Club — Seminyak

Potato Head is the beach club that put Bali on the global scene. The striking facade — built from thousands of repurposed vintage shutters — has become one of the most photographed buildings on the island. Inside, a sprawling complex includes an infinity pool, multiple restaurants, bars, a recording studio, and an art gallery.

The vibe is stylish without being pretentious, attracting a well-dressed crowd who appreciate good design, strong cocktails, and quality music programming. Sunday sessions are legendary, with DJs playing from afternoon into the evening.

**Vibe:** Stylish, design-forward, social
**Music:** Curated house and disco, live acts
**Entry:** Free (minimum spend on daybeds)
**Daybed cost:** $40-100 depending on day and location
**Best for:** Design lovers, Instagram, Sunday sessions
**Area:** [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/)

### Finns Beach Club — Canggu

Finns is Bali's largest beach club complex and functions almost like a self-contained entertainment district. The main beach club has a massive pool, tiered daybed areas, multiple bars, and regular live DJ sets. But the broader Finns complex also includes a water slide park, a bowling alley, a gym, a trampoline center, and several restaurants.

The atmosphere skews younger and more energetic than Seminyak's offerings. It's the kind of place where you arrive at noon for a swim and suddenly realize it's 10 PM and you're dancing barefoot on the sand. The parties during peak season attract serious international talent.

**Vibe:** High-energy, young, party-ready
**Music:** Commercial house, EDM, guest DJs
**Entry:** From $15 (redeemable on food/drinks)
**Daybed cost:** $25-80
**Best for:** Groups, party atmosphere, all-day sessions
**Area:** [Canggu](/areas/canggu/)

### Savaya — Uluwatu

Savaya (formerly Omnia) is the most architecturally dramatic beach club in Bali — possibly in the world. Built into the limestone cliffs of [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/), the club features a massive three-tiered deck that seems to float above the Indian Ocean, connected to the clifftop by a glass-bottomed bridge. The infinity pool appears to merge with the ocean below.

The music programming at Savaya is genuinely world-class, regularly bringing in headliners who would sell out arenas elsewhere. This is Bali's answer to Ibiza — a premium, no-expense-spared party experience in an unforgettable setting. Prices reflect the positioning, but the experience delivers.

**Vibe:** Ultra-premium, dramatic, party
**Music:** World-class DJs, electronic, house
**Entry:** $30-50 (higher for special events)
**Daybed cost:** $100-300+
**Best for:** Special occasions, music lovers, bucket-list experiences
**Area:** Uluwatu

### Sundays Beach Club — Uluwatu

A completely different proposition from Savaya despite being in the same area. Sundays is accessed by an inclinator (cliff elevator) that descends to a secluded white-sand cove — a genuine hidden beach that feels worlds away from Bali's crowds. The vibe is relaxed and family-friendly during the day, with kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, and snorkeling gear available.

The food is excellent — wood-fired pizzas, fresh seafood, and proper cocktails served in the sand. As the afternoon progresses, the music picks up slightly, but this never becomes a party venue. It's all about the setting and the sense of escape.

**Vibe:** Relaxed, secluded, family-friendly
**Music:** Chilled beats, acoustic sessions
**Entry:** $35 (redeemable on food/drinks)
**Daybed cost:** $50-150
**Best for:** Couples, families, escaping crowds
**Area:** Uluwatu

## Chill & Relaxed Beach Clubs

### La Brisa — Canggu

Built almost entirely from recycled wood from old Indonesian fishing boats, La Brisa has one of the most distinctive aesthetics of any venue in Bali. The rustic-bohemian design, combined with a beachfront location at Echo Beach, creates an atmosphere that feels organic and lived-in rather than manufactured.

The food is Mediterranean-leaning with Indonesian accents, and the cocktail list is creative. Sunset here is magical — the crowd is relaxed, the music is understated, and the whole scene has an end-of-the-world romance to it. It gets busier in the evenings but never tips into chaotic.

**Vibe:** Bohemian, eco-chic, romantic
**Music:** Chilled house, world music, acoustic
**Entry:** Free
**Daybed cost:** $20-60
**Best for:** Couples, sunset drinks, eco-conscious travelers

### The Lawn — Canggu

Giant beanbags scattered across a manicured lawn overlooking Batu Bolong Beach — that's the concept, and it works beautifully. The Lawn is one of Canggu's most popular sunset spots, and the relaxed vibe attracts a mix of surfers, digital nomads, and young travelers who want a social atmosphere without the intensity of a full-blown party.

**Vibe:** Casual, social, sunset-focused
**Music:** Chilled beats, occasional live music
**Entry:** Free
**Daybed/beanbag cost:** Free with food/drink orders
**Best for:** Casual afternoons, groups, budget-conscious visitors

### Ulu Cliffhouse — Uluwatu

Perched on the cliffs above Uluwatu, Ulu Cliffhouse is a multi-level venue with a pool, restaurant, and bar that takes full advantage of its dramatic setting. The atmosphere is more refined than Canggu's beach clubs but more relaxed than Savaya. It's a strong mid-point for travelers who want a beautiful setting and good food without committing to a full party experience.

**Vibe:** Refined casual, clifftop elegance
**Music:** Deep house, lounge
**Entry:** $25 (redeemable)
**Daybed cost:** $50-100
**Best for:** Couples, sunset cocktails, photography

### Palmilla Beach Club — Seminyak

A more intimate alternative to Potato Head, Palmilla offers a boutique beach club experience with a focus on food quality. The Mediterranean menu is strong, the cocktails are well-crafted, and the smaller footprint means it never feels overcrowded. The beachfront position catches excellent sunset light.

**Vibe:** Intimate, food-focused, boutique
**Music:** Lounge, chilled house
**Entry:** Free
**Daybed cost:** $30-60
**Best for:** Foodies, couples, relaxed afternoons

## Party Beach Clubs

### Atlas Beach Fest — Canggu

Atlas opened in 2023 as Canggu's answer to the mega-club concept and immediately became one of the most talked-about venues in Bali. The sheer scale is staggering — it claims to be the largest beach club in the world, with a capacity of over 5,000 people, multiple pools, and a lineup of international bars and food vendors.

The party programming is aggressive, with big-name DJs and themed events throughout the week. It's loud, chaotic, and unapologetically commercial — which either excites or repels depending on your preferences. Love it or avoid it, it's become impossible to ignore.

**Vibe:** Mega-club, party, high-energy
**Music:** EDM, commercial house, hip-hop
**Entry:** $15-30 (event-dependent)
**Daybed cost:** $30-100
**Best for:** Party seekers, groups, big nights out

### Mari Beach Club — Seminyak

Mari brings Mykonos energy to Bali's coastline, with all-white decor, premium bottle service, and a crowd that comes dressed to impress. The music leans toward melodic house and tech-house, and the pool area becomes a dance floor as the afternoon progresses. It's a newer addition to the Seminyak scene and has quickly carved out a niche as the upscale party option.

**Vibe:** Upscale party, Mykonos-inspired
**Music:** Melodic house, tech-house
**Entry:** $20-40
**Daybed cost:** $50-150
**Best for:** Groups looking for an upscale party

### Café del Mar — Canggu

The Ibiza export landed in Bali with its signature blend of sunset sessions and electronic music. The beachfront setting at Batu Bolong is excellent, and the programming stays true to the brand's roots — melodic house and balearic beats that build from afternoon chill to evening party. It's more refined than Atlas and more lively than La Brisa, hitting a sweet spot for travelers who want energy without chaos.

**Vibe:** Ibiza-inspired, sunset sessions
**Music:** Balearic, melodic house
**Entry:** Free-$20
**Daybed cost:** $30-80
**Best for:** Music lovers, sunset-to-evening sessions

## Hidden Gems & Off-the-Beaten-Path

### Ume Beach — Seminyak

A smaller, less-discovered spot on Seminyak's northern end, Ume Beach offers a more authentic beach experience without the branding and posturing of the bigger clubs. The food is surprisingly good, the drinks are fairly priced, and the lack of crowds means you can actually relax. It's the closest thing to old-school Bali beach vibes in an area that's increasingly polished.

### Single Fin — Uluwatu

Not technically a beach club but an institution nonetheless. Single Fin sits on the cliffs above Uluwatu's famous surf break, and the views are among the best in Bali. Sunday sessions with live music and cheap beers draw a mix of surfers, backpackers, and tourists. The vibe is effortlessly cool, the sunset views are world-class, and you don't need a minimum spend or a reservation.

**Best for:** Surfers, budget travelers, authentic vibes

### Lembongan Beach Club — Nusa Lembongan

If you're willing to take the 30-minute fast boat to Nusa Lembongan, you'll find a beach club scene that's calmer and more affordable than anything on the main island. Crystal-clear water, white sand, and a fraction of the crowds make this a compelling alternative for a day trip.

## How to Choose the Right Beach Club

**For couples:** Sundays Beach Club or La Brisa — intimate, romantic, stunning settings without the party pressure.

**For groups of friends:** Finns or Atlas — high energy, multiple areas, easy to accommodate big groups.

**For a special occasion:** Savaya — the setting is unmatched, and the experience is genuinely once-in-a-lifetime.

**For families:** Sundays Beach Club — the private beach and calm water make it kid-friendly, and the inclinator ride is an adventure in itself.

**On a budget:** The Lawn or Single Fin — free entry, great atmosphere, and you control your spend.

**For music lovers:** Savaya or Café del Mar — the programming at these venues goes well beyond background music.

## Practical Tips

- **Book daybeds in advance** for weekends and holidays, especially at Potato Head, Sundays, and Savaya
- **Dress code matters** at premium venues — swimwear is fine poolside, but many clubs expect a step up for dinner and evening areas
- **Arrive for sunset** — most beach clubs face west, and the golden-hour light between 5-6 PM is when the atmosphere peaks
- **Check event calendars** — many clubs host themed events, guest DJs, and special parties on specific nights
- **Transport home:** Don't ride a scooter after drinking. Use Grab/Gojek or arrange a [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) for the day

## Let Gede Set Up Your Beach Club Day

Between booking daybeds, timing your arrival for sunset, and figuring out transport between venues, planning a beach club day involves more logistics than it should. Gede can reserve the best spots, arrange transport, and build a full day that combines a morning [surf lesson](/activities/surfing-lessons/) or [temple visit](/activities/temple-tours/) with an afternoon at the beach club of your choice.

Bali has two major wildlife parks that offer very different experiences: the intimate Bali Zoo in Gianyar and the sprawling Bali Safari & Marine Park in Gianyar's eastern reaches. Both are well-run, family-friendly attractions that go beyond the typical zoo experience with interactive animal encounters, cultural shows, and tropical garden settings.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about both parks so you can decide which one (or both) to visit, and how to make the most of your time there.

## Bali Zoo (Kebun Binatang Bali)

### Overview

Located in Singapadu village, about 20 minutes south of central Ubud, Bali Zoo is the smaller and more intimate of the two parks. It sits on 3.5 hectares of tropical gardens and is home to over 500 animals from more than 100 species, with a strong focus on Indonesian wildlife.

What makes Bali Zoo stand out is the close-contact philosophy. Many of the animal encounters are hands-on — you can feed elephants, hold birds of prey, and interact with animals in ways that larger parks don't always allow.

### Animals and Exhibits

**Indonesian Highlights:**
- **Sumatran Elephants:** The stars of the zoo. You can feed them, watch their bathing sessions, and book a private elephant encounter.
- **Komodo Dragons:** Indonesia's famous giant lizards in a purpose-built habitat.
- **Sun Bears:** The world's smallest bears, native to Borneo and Sumatra.
- **Orangutans:** Bali Zoo participates in conservation programs for these critically endangered apes.
- **Sumatran Tigers:** Impressive big cats in a naturalistic enclosure.

**Other species:** Crocodiles, cassowaries, spotted deer, otters, various reptiles, tropical birds, and a good collection of primates.

The zoo also has an impressive tropical garden with labeled plant species, making the walk between exhibits genuinely pleasant rather than just a transition between enclosures.

### Experiences and Shows

**Animal Encounters:**
- **Elephant Mud Fun:** Bathe and play in the mud with Sumatran elephants. One of the most popular activities, especially for kids. Book in advance.
- **Breakfast with Orangutans:** Eat your morning meal while orangutans dine next to you. A unique experience that runs daily at 8:30 AM.
- **Bird of Prey Show:** Live falconry demonstration with hawks and owls.
- **Meet the Keeper:** Scheduled talks where zookeepers share information about specific animals and their conservation status.

**Night at the Zoo:**
One of Bali Zoo's most popular programs. Available on select evenings, the night experience includes a guided tour of the zoo after dark (when many animals are most active), a fire dance performance, and a traditional Balinese dinner. It's an entirely different atmosphere from the daytime visit.

### Practical Information

**Opening hours:** 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM daily

**Ticket prices (approximate):**
- Adult general admission: 450,000-550,000 IDR ($28-35 USD)
- Child (2-12): 300,000-400,000 IDR ($19-25 USD)
- Packages with animal encounters: 600,000-1,200,000 IDR ($38-76 USD)
- Night at the Zoo: 800,000-1,000,000 IDR ($50-63 USD)

**Tips:**
- Buy tickets online in advance — it's almost always cheaper than the gate price.
- Arrive when the gates open at 9 AM. The animals are most active in the morning, and it's cooler.
- The elephant encounters and Breakfast with Orangutans sell out, especially in peak season. Book these separately.

**Getting there:** 20 minutes from Ubud, 50-60 minutes from Seminyak/Canggu, 40 minutes from Sanur.

## Bali Safari & Marine Park

### Overview

Bali Safari & Marine Park is the larger, more ambitious of the two parks. Located near the coast at Gianyar, it covers over 40 hectares and houses more than 1,000 animals from 120 species. The park is organized around different continental zones — Indonesia, India, and Africa — that you travel through on a guided safari bus.

It's modeled partly on the open-range safari parks found in Africa and Australia, with animals roaming in large enclosures that the safari bus drives through. The scale and production value are significantly higher than Bali Zoo, and there's easily a full day's worth of activities here.

### The Safari Experience

The centerpiece of the park is the safari bus journey. Air-conditioned buses with large windows follow a route through three zones:

**Indonesian Zone:** Sumatran elephants, Komodo dragons, Bali starlings (the island's critically endangered endemic bird), spotted deer, and Sumatran tigers in a naturalistic forest setting.

**Indian Zone:** Nilgai (blue bulls), blackbuck antelope, Indian rhinoceros, and Himalayan bears in a savanna-like landscape.

**African Zone:** The showpiece. Lions, zebras, wildebeest, hippos, cheetahs, and white rhinoceros roam in large open enclosures. The bus drives close enough that you'll see these animals clearly without barriers.

The safari loop takes about 30-45 minutes and can be repeated throughout the day.

### Shows and Attractions

**Bali Agung Show:** A large-scale theatrical production combining Balinese mythology with live animals, acrobatics, and special effects. It's performed in a purpose-built indoor theater and runs about 45 minutes. The production quality is genuinely impressive.

**Elephant Show:** Daily performances showcasing the intelligence and agility of Asian elephants.

**Animal Education Show:** Features a rotating cast of animals demonstrating natural behaviors — raptors in flight, orangutan problem-solving, and more.

**Harimau (Tiger) Show:** Tigers demonstrating their hunting instincts through play and training exercises.

### Other Facilities

**Water Park (Umah Segara):** A full water park with slides, wave pool, and a lazy river. Included in some ticket packages. Excellent for keeping kids happy in the afternoon heat.

**Fun Zone:** Carnival rides and amusement park attractions for younger children.

**Bali Theater:** Hosts the Bali Agung show and occasional special events.

**Night Safari:** Similar concept to the daytime safari but conducted after dark with special lighting that allows you to see nocturnal animal behavior. Includes a cultural show and dinner.

### Practical Information

**Opening hours:** 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM daily (Night Safari operates separately, typically 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM)

**Ticket prices (approximate):**
- Jungle Hopper (safari + animal shows): 550,000-700,000 IDR ($35-44 USD)
- Explorer Package (safari + shows + water park + rides): 750,000-950,000 IDR ($47-60 USD)
- Legend Package (all access + elephant ride + lunch): 1,200,000-1,500,000 IDR ($76-95 USD)
- Night Safari: 700,000-900,000 IDR ($44-57 USD)

**Tips:**
- Budget a full day if you get the Explorer or Legend package. There's genuinely too much to see in half a day.
- The park is spread out — wear comfortable walking shoes and bring sun protection.
- The air-conditioned safari bus is the best part. Sit on the left side going out for the best animal views.
- The water park is a lifesaver in the afternoon when the heat peaks and younger kids start to fade.

**Getting there:** 45 minutes from Ubud, 70-90 minutes from Seminyak/Canggu, 30 minutes from Sanur.

## Bali Zoo vs. Bali Safari: Which Should You Visit?

This is the question most visitors wrestle with, and the answer depends on your group and priorities.

### Choose Bali Zoo If:

- You have younger children (under 6) who would benefit from a smaller, more manageable park
- You want intimate, hands-on animal encounters
- You're already visiting the Ubud area and want a half-day activity
- You're interested in the Night at the Zoo experience
- Budget is a consideration — Bali Zoo is generally cheaper

### Choose Bali Safari If:

- You want the full safari bus experience with animals roaming in open enclosures
- You're traveling with older kids or teenagers who'd enjoy the water park and rides
- You want a full-day attraction with multiple shows and activities
- You're interested in seeing a wider range of African and Indian species
- You want the bigger production value

### Visit Both If:

You're in Bali for a week or more with family and want dedicated activity days. They're different enough that visiting both doesn't feel repetitive. Bali Zoo works well as a half-day morning visit combined with Ubud sightseeing, while Bali Safari fills an entire day on its own.

## Tips for Visiting with Kids

Both parks are well-suited for families, but a few tips will make the experience smoother:

**For toddlers and young children (1-4):**
- Bali Zoo's compact size is more manageable. Little legs tire fast.
- Bring a stroller — both parks have paved paths.
- The early morning is best. Kids and animals are both more alert.
- Pack snacks. The on-site food is decent but priced at tourist-attraction levels.

**For school-age kids (5-12):**
- Both parks work well. Bali Safari's water park and rides add variety.
- The interactive shows and animal encounters are the highlights — check the daily schedule as soon as you arrive and plan around them.
- Let kids use a camera or phone for their own photos. It keeps them engaged between exhibits.

**For teenagers:**
- Bali Safari's scale and variety will hold their attention longer.
- The Night Safari is genuinely cool for this age group.
- Combine a zoo visit with something else they'll enjoy — [surfing lessons](/blog/ultimate-guide-to-bali/) or a trip to a beach club rounds out the day nicely.

## Conservation and Ethics

Both Bali Zoo and Bali Safari & Marine Park participate in conservation programs for endangered Indonesian species. Bali Zoo is involved in breeding programs for Sumatran elephants and orangutans, while Bali Safari supports the Bali Starling conservation effort — the island's only endemic bird species, which was nearly extinct in the wild.

If ethical animal tourism matters to you (and it should), both parks are accredited by SEAZA (Southeast Asian Zoos and Aquariums Association) and operate to modern standards. The enclosures are reasonably sized, the animals appear well-cared-for, and the educational programs emphasize conservation rather than pure entertainment.

That said, if riding elephants is important to you, know that this remains a debated practice globally. Both parks have moved toward more ethical elephant interaction models — bathing, feeding, and observation rather than traditional riding with a howdah (seat).

## Getting the Best Deals on Tickets

Gate prices are almost always the most expensive option. Here's how to save:

- **Book online:** Both parks offer discounts of 10-30% for online bookings.
- **Package deals:** Combo packages (safari + shows + water park) offer much better per-activity value than buying everything separately.
- **Third-party booking platforms:** Sites like Klook and Get Your Guide often have discounted rates with added perks.
- **Local concierge booking:** A local operator like Chill Bali Trips can often access local rates or package the tickets with transport for better overall value.

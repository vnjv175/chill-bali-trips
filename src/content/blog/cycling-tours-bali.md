Cycling in Bali is one of those activities that consistently surprises visitors. Most people don't come to the island planning to ride a bike, but those who do rate it among their top experiences. There's something about rolling through rice terraces, past stone temples, and through quiet villages at cycling speed that reveals a side of Bali you simply can't see from a car window or a scooter seat.

The island's volcanic terrain creates natural elevation gradients that tour operators have exploited brilliantly — most popular cycling routes are predominantly downhill, meaning you get spectacular scenery and cultural immersion with minimal physical effort. Even if you haven't been on a bike in years, there's a Bali cycling tour that works for you.

## The Classic Downhill Tours

### Kintamani to Ubud

This is the most popular cycling tour in Bali, and for good reason. You start near the Mount Batur volcano at around 1,400 meters elevation and coast downhill for 25-30 kilometers through some of the island's most beautiful landscapes.

**The route typically includes:**
- A starting point near Kintamani with panoramic views of Mount Batur and its crater lake
- A descent through cool highland villages where the air temperature is noticeably lower than the coast
- Rides through coffee and clove plantations
- Stops at traditional Balinese compounds where a local family shows you their home layout (every compound follows specific Hindu rules for building placement)
- Passage through dense tropical forest
- The iconic rice terrace section as you approach the Ubud area
- A finish point in or near Ubud, usually followed by lunch

**Elevation loss:** Approximately 800-1,000 meters over 25-30 km
**Duration:** 3-4 hours including stops (2-2.5 hours actual riding)
**Difficulty:** Easy — it's almost entirely downhill. Suitable for anyone who can ride a bicycle.
**Cost:** $35-60 USD per person including hotel pickup, bike, helmet, guide, and lunch.

This is genuinely one of the best-value activities in Bali. The combination of volcano views, village culture, rice terraces, and a hot lunch for under $50 per person is hard to beat.

### Jatiluwih Rice Terrace Route

For riders who want to see Bali's most spectacular rice terraces, the Jatiluwih route in Tabanan regency is unmatched. Jatiluwih is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with a traditional irrigation system (subak) that has been operating for over a thousand years.

**The route:**
- Starts in the highlands north of Jatiluwih
- Winds through terraced rice paddies that stretch to the horizon
- Passes through quiet farming villages that see far fewer tourists than the Ubud area
- Rolling terrain with some gentle uphills (slightly more effort than the Kintamani route)
- Finishes with a lunch at a restaurant overlooking the terraces

**Distance:** 20-25 km
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy to moderate — a few gentle climbs but nothing strenuous
**Cost:** $40-70 USD per person

The advantage of Jatiluwih is the scale and authenticity of the rice terrace scenery. The terraces here are working agricultural land, not a tourist attraction with swing sets bolted on. You'll see farmers knee-deep in paddies, water buffalo plowing fields, and ducks waddling between the rice rows.

### East Bali: Sidemen Valley

The Sidemen Valley in East Bali is one of the island's best-kept secrets, and cycling through it is an extraordinary experience. The route passes beneath the towering presence of Mount Agung, Bali's highest and most sacred volcano.

**The route:**
- Descends from the highland village of Iseh toward the Sidemen valley floor
- Passes through salak (snake fruit) plantations, rice paddies, and weaving villages
- Traditional Bali at its most rural — don't expect coffee shops or tourist infrastructure here
- Smaller roads with almost no traffic
- Views of Mount Agung that dominate every direction

**Distance:** 15-25 km depending on the operator
**Duration:** 2.5-3.5 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy to moderate
**Cost:** $45-75 USD per person

Sidemen is ideal for anyone who has already seen the Ubud area and wants something off the beaten path. The valley has a peaceful, timeless quality that more developed parts of Bali have lost.

## Village and Cultural Cycling Tours

### Ubud Village Tour

Instead of a downhill route, Ubud village cycling tours stay on the flat-to-gently-rolling terrain around Ubud itself. These tours focus less on scenery and more on cultural encounters.

**What you'll see:**
- Local artisan workshops — wood carving, silver jewelry, batik fabric
- Small village temples and shrines being prepared for ceremonies
- Traditional markets where locals shop (not the tourist markets)
- School visits (when classes are in session) — kids love waving at passing cyclists
- Rice paddies on the outskirts of town

**Distance:** 10-15 km
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Cost:** $30-50 USD per person

This is the best option for anyone who wants cultural depth over physical challenge. The guides on these tours are usually excellent at explaining Balinese customs, religion, and daily life.

### Canggu to Tanah Lot

A coastal and rural route that takes you from the beaches of Canggu through the rice paddies and villages of the Tabanan coast toward the famous Tanah Lot sea temple.

**What you'll see:**
- Canggu's rural hinterland (rice paddies just minutes from the surf breaks)
- Coastal villages with black sand beaches
- Traditional salt farming areas
- Tanah Lot temple as the endpoint (or turnaround point)

**Distance:** 15-20 km one way
**Duration:** 2-3 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy (mostly flat coastal terrain)
**Cost:** $35-55 USD per person with a guided tour; free if self-guided

## Self-Guided Cycling

If organized tours feel too structured, self-guided cycling is absolutely viable in Bali — with some caveats.

### Renting a Bicycle

**In Ubud:** Several shops along Jalan Raya Ubud and Jalan Monkey Forest rent standard mountain bikes for 50,000-80,000 IDR ($3-5 USD) per day. Quality varies — check the brakes and tires before you ride off.

**In Canggu:** Beach cruisers and mountain bikes are available from guesthouses and rental shops for similar prices. Canggu's flat terrain is well-suited to casual cycling.

**E-bikes:** Electric bikes are becoming more available, typically 150,000-250,000 IDR ($10-16 USD) per day. These are a game-changer for Bali's hills — all the scenery, none of the sweat.

### Best Self-Guided Routes

**Campuhan Ridge Walk extension (Ubud):** Start from the famous ridge walk and continue north on quiet roads through Bangkiang Sidem and Keliki villages. Mostly paved, light traffic, stunning views.

**Sanur Coastal Path:** A paved beachfront path running several kilometers along Sanur's coast. Flat, safe, scenic, and family-friendly. Bikes are rentable right along the path.

**Munduk to Wanagiri:** In North Bali, the roads between Munduk and Wanagiri pass through cloud forest and beside twin lakes. Hilly but spectacular. Only for fit riders or e-bikes.

### Safety Tips for Self-Guided Riding

Cycling independently in Bali requires awareness. The roads weren't designed for bicycles, and traffic can be intense.

- **Avoid main roads.** Stick to village roads and secondary routes. The main highways (especially between Denpasar and Ubud) have heavy traffic and narrow shoulders.
- **Ride in the morning.** Traffic is lighter, the temperature is cooler, and you avoid afternoon rain (in wet season).
- **Wear a helmet.** Not all rental shops provide one — bring your own if it matters to you.
- **Carry water.** Dehydration is a real risk in Bali's heat and humidity, especially on longer rides.
- **Download offline maps.** Google Maps works for cycling navigation, and offline maps ensure you won't lose signal in rural areas.
- **Watch for dogs.** Village dogs sometimes chase cyclists. Slowing down or stopping usually makes them lose interest. Don't swerve into traffic.

## What to Expect on a Guided Tour

If you've booked a standard guided cycling tour, here's how the day typically goes:

**5:30-7:00 AM:** Hotel pickup. Most tours start early to beat the heat. A minivan or bus takes your group to the starting elevation.

**7:30-8:00 AM:** Arrival at the starting point, often with breakfast or a hot drink included. The guide fits everyone with bikes and helmets.

**8:00 AM:** Safety briefing and departure. The guide leads from the front or back, depending on group size. A support vehicle follows with water and backup bikes.

**8:00-11:00 AM:** The ride itself, with 3-5 stops for photos, cultural explanations, and water breaks. The pace is relaxed — no one is being timed.

**11:00-11:30 AM:** Arrival at the endpoint, usually followed by a traditional Balinese lunch at a restaurant.

**12:00-1:00 PM:** Return transport to your hotel.

**Group sizes** typically range from 4-15 riders. Smaller groups (under 8) generally offer a better experience since the guide can give more individual attention and the stops are more flexible.

## Who Is Cycling in Bali Good For?

**Families with kids (8+):** The downhill tours are suitable for children who can ride a bike confidently. Most operators have smaller bikes available. Kids under 8 can sometimes ride in the support vehicle and join at stops.

**Couples:** The combination of scenery, culture, and gentle exercise makes cycling one of the best couple's activities in Bali. It's active without being exhausting, and the shared experience creates stronger memories than a passive sightseeing tour.

**Solo travelers:** Guided tours are a great way to meet other travelers. Group sizes are usually small enough that you'll actually get to know people.

**Older travelers:** The downhill routes require very little physical effort. If you can sit on a bike seat, you can do this tour.

**Fitness enthusiasts:** The standard downhill tours might feel too easy for you. Consider self-guided routes with actual climbing, like the Munduk area, or ask operators about their more challenging options.

## Best Time for Cycling in Bali

**Dry season (April-October):** Best conditions. Dry roads, clear skies, and comfortable temperatures in the highlands. Book in advance during June-August (peak season).

**Wet season (November-March):** Morning rides are usually fine — rain typically comes in the afternoon. Roads can be slippery, and some operators adjust their routes. The upside: fewer tourists and greener landscapes.

**Time of day:** Early morning, always. By 10 AM, the equatorial sun is strong and the roads get busier.

## Combining Cycling with Other Activities

A morning cycling tour pairs perfectly with afternoon activities. After a Kintamani-to-Ubud ride, you're already in the Ubud area — perfect for visiting the [Monkey Forest, art galleries, or the Tegallalang terraces](/blog/things-to-do-ubud/). After the Canggu-Tanah Lot route, you're positioned for a sunset at the temple before heading back for dinner.

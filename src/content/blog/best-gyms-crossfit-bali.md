One of the best things about spending extended time in Bali is that you don't have to sacrifice your fitness routine. In fact, you might improve it. The island — particularly the Canggu and Seminyak corridor — has developed a serious fitness infrastructure that rivals many Western cities. World-class CrossFit boxes, fully equipped bodybuilding gyms, outdoor functional training spaces, and everything in between.

Whether you're a digital nomad who needs a daily gym, a vacationer who wants to sweat out last night's cocktails, or a serious athlete passing through, this guide covers the best options across Bali's main areas.

## Canggu

Canggu is the undisputed fitness capital of Bali. The concentration of gyms per square kilometer here is absurd — a direct result of the digital nomad and expat community that has made this area home. Competition has pushed quality up and kept prices reasonable.

### S2S CrossFit Bali

The gold standard for CrossFit in Bali. S2S (Sweat to Smile) is a fully affiliated CrossFit box with excellent coaching, a strong community vibe, and programming that matches what you'd find at a top box anywhere in the world.

**Facilities:** Open-air box with full rig systems, rowers, bikes, barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, and everything you need for competitive CrossFit. The outdoor setting means you train in fresh air — though the Bali heat adds a layer of intensity.

**Classes:** WODs run multiple times throughout the day. Drop-in visitors are welcome and coaches are good at scaling workouts for different levels.

**Pricing:** Drop-in around 200,000-250,000 IDR ($13-16 USD). Weekly and monthly passes available for better value.

**Vibe:** Welcoming to visitors but serious about the work. Expect a mix of long-term expats and traveling athletes.

### Finns Recreation Club

Finns is more than a gym — it's a massive recreation complex with fitness facilities, pools, a bowling alley, a trampoline park, and a sports bar. The gym component is a full-service fitness center with modern equipment.

**Facilities:** Air-conditioned gym floor with a wide range of cardio machines, cable stations, free weights, and functional training areas. Also has a 25-meter lap pool, tennis courts, and group fitness studios.

**Classes:** Extensive schedule including yoga, Pilates, spin, boxing, and HIIT.

**Pricing:** Day passes from 200,000-350,000 IDR ($13-22 USD) including pool and gym access. Monthly memberships available.

**Vibe:** Resort-style fitness. Popular with families and those who want to combine a workout with pool time and a meal afterward.

### The Body Factory Bali

A pure bodybuilding and strength training gym with serious iron. If your training revolves around barbells and dumbbells rather than WODs and met-cons, this is your spot in Canggu.

**Facilities:** Squat racks, deadlift platforms, a large dumbbell range (up to 50 kg+), cable machines, plate-loaded machines, and a functional training area. Air-conditioned.

**Pricing:** Day pass around 100,000-150,000 IDR ($6-10 USD). One of the better-value options in Canggu.

**Vibe:** No-nonsense gym. People are here to lift.

### Canggu Studio

A boutique fitness studio that focuses on group classes — boxing, HIIT, yoga, and Pilates. The classes are well-coached and the studio is clean and modern.

**Pricing:** Class-based pricing. Drop-in classes from 150,000-200,000 IDR ($10-13 USD).

**Vibe:** Popular with the yoga-brunch crowd. Good quality training in a more curated atmosphere.

### Tamora Gallery Gym

A more traditional Balinese gym that caters to both locals and expats. It won't win any design awards, but the equipment is solid and the prices are the lowest in Canggu.

**Pricing:** As low as 50,000-70,000 IDR ($3-5 USD) per day.

**Vibe:** No frills, no Instagram aesthetics, just weights and machines at local prices.

## Seminyak

Seminyak's fitness scene is smaller than Canggu's but has a few standout options, particularly for people who prefer boutique studios over raw iron.

### Bodyworks Bali

One of the longest-running gyms in the Seminyak area. Bodyworks has a fully equipped gym floor plus a pool, spa, and a range of classes.

**Facilities:** Free weights, machines, cardio equipment, functional training area, group fitness studio, 18-meter pool, and a spa. Air-conditioned throughout.

**Classes:** Group fitness schedule includes boxing, TRX, circuit training, yoga, and Pilates.

**Pricing:** Day pass around 150,000-200,000 IDR ($10-13 USD) for gym only, or 250,000-350,000 IDR ($16-22 USD) with pool and spa access. Monthly memberships offer much better value for longer stays.

**Vibe:** Well-maintained, professional atmosphere. Popular with both expats and hotel guests from nearby resorts.

### Motion Fitness Bali

A smaller but well-equipped gym focused on functional fitness and personal training. Good quality equipment in a compact space.

**Pricing:** Day pass around 100,000-150,000 IDR ($6-10 USD).

**Vibe:** Friendly, community-oriented. Trainers are hands-on and approachable.

### 20Fit EMS Studio

Something different — electro muscle stimulation (EMS) training. You wear a suit that sends electrical impulses to your muscles while performing exercises, making a 20-minute session equivalent to a much longer conventional workout. It's a niche approach, but the Seminyak location is well-run.

**Pricing:** Sessions from 350,000-500,000 IDR ($22-32 USD).

**Best for:** Time-crunched travelers who want an efficient workout.

## Ubud

Ubud's fitness landscape leans heavily toward yoga and wellness, but there are options for conventional gym training too.

### Ubud Fitness Centre

The main gym option in central Ubud. It's a no-frills facility with the essentials — free weights, machines, cardio equipment, and a functional area.

**Facilities:** Basic but functional. Squat rack, bench press, dumbbells, cable machines, treadmills, and bikes. The equipment is older than what you'll find in Canggu but perfectly serviceable.

**Pricing:** 70,000-100,000 IDR ($4-6 USD) per day. Very affordable.

**Vibe:** Quiet, local feel. Don't expect a social gym atmosphere — people are here to train and leave.

### The Yoga Barn

Not a gym in the traditional sense, but The Yoga Barn is an institution in Ubud and deserves mention for anyone whose fitness practice includes yoga. It offers dozens of classes daily across multiple styles — vinyasa, hatha, yin, aerial, kundalini, and more.

**Pricing:** Drop-in classes from 130,000-180,000 IDR ($8-11 USD). Multi-class passes available.

**Vibe:** The epicenter of Ubud's wellness scene. Expect a mix of serious practitioners and travelers trying yoga for the first time.

### Bali Silent Retreat (Near Ubud)

For a different kind of physical and mental training, the Bali Silent Retreat combines yoga, meditation, and movement practices in a technology-free environment. It's not a gym, but it's a powerful reset for your body and mind.

### Hotel Gyms

Several of the larger hotels and resorts in the Ubud area (COMO Shambhala, Viceroy, Mandapa) have excellent gym facilities, though access is typically restricted to guests or comes with a premium day-use fee.

## Uluwatu / Bukit Peninsula

The Bukit is the most underserved area for gym facilities, but a few options exist — and the natural terrain itself is a workout (those cliff staircases to the beaches are no joke).

### Uluwatu Surf Villas Gym

A compact but well-equipped gym attached to the Uluwatu Surf Villas complex. It has the essentials for strength and cardio training.

**Pricing:** Available to villa guests; day passes sometimes available for non-guests.

### Sunday's Beach Club Gym

The gym at Sunday's Beach Club is small but decent, and you get the added benefit of post-workout access to one of Bali's best beach clubs. Train, then swim in a secluded cove. Not a bad setup.

### Outdoor Training

The Bukit peninsula's terrain — steep cliff paths, sandy beaches, and limestone formations — lends itself to outdoor functional training. Running the stairs down to Padang Padang or Suluban Beach is a legitimate leg workout. Several personal trainers in the area offer outdoor sessions on the cliffs and beaches.

## General Tips for Training in Bali

### Hydration and Heat

This can't be overstated. Bali's combination of high heat and extreme humidity means you'll lose fluid and electrolytes faster than you're used to. Drink significantly more water than you normally would — before, during, and after training. Coconut water is cheap, available everywhere, and an excellent natural electrolyte source.

If you're coming from a cooler climate, give yourself 3-5 days to acclimatize before pushing hard. Reduce intensity and volume for the first few sessions.

### Timing Your Workouts

The coolest part of the day is early morning (6-8 AM) and late afternoon (4-6 PM). Midday training in a non-air-conditioned gym or outdoor box is genuinely brutal. Plan accordingly.

### Gym Etiquette

The same rules apply as anywhere: wipe down equipment, rerack your weights, don't hog the squat rack for curls. Bali's gym community is generally friendly and welcoming to visitors — respect the space and you'll have a great time.

### Monthly Memberships vs. Drop-Ins

If you're staying for a month or more, a monthly membership almost always makes financial sense. Most gyms offer memberships in the range of 500,000-1,500,000 IDR ($32-95 USD) per month — dramatically cheaper than drop-in rates over 30 days.

### Personal Training

Personal training in Bali is a genuine bargain compared to Western countries. Sessions typically run 300,000-600,000 IDR ($19-38 USD) with qualified trainers. Many are internationally certified and have trained competitive athletes. If you've been wanting to work with a PT but couldn't justify the cost at home, Bali is the place to do it.

## Combining Fitness with Your Bali Trip

The beauty of Bali's fitness scene is that it integrates seamlessly with the rest of your trip. Hit the gym early morning, work or explore during the day, then wind down with a [spa and recovery session](/blog/recovery-wellness-bali/) in the evening. Surfers can supplement their wave time with land-based strength work. Yogis can add weight training to balance their practice.

If you're planning an active trip that combines gym sessions with [cycling tours](/blog/cycling-tours-bali/), water sports, and adventure activities, having a local guide who understands the logistics saves a lot of wasted time.

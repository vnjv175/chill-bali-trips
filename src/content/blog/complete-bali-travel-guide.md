Bali is one of those rare places that lives up to the hype. The rice terraces really are that green, the temples really are that atmospheric, and the people really are that warm. But showing up without a basic understanding of how things work here can lead to unnecessary stress, overpaying, or accidentally offending someone.

This guide covers everything a first-time visitor needs to know — the practical stuff that Instagram does not show you.

## Visas and Entry Requirements

### Visa on Arrival (VOA)

Most visitors to Bali arrive on a Visa on Arrival, which you purchase at Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS). As of 2026:

- **Cost:** 500,000 IDR (roughly $30 USD), payable in rupiah or by card
- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Extendable:** Yes, once, for an additional 30 days (must be done at an immigration office before expiry)
- **Eligible countries:** Over 90 countries including USA, UK, Australia, Canada, and most of Europe

The VOA line is separate from the immigration queue. Pay first, get your sticker, then join the immigration line. The whole process takes 20 to 60 minutes depending on flight arrivals.

### E-VOA (Electronic Visa on Arrival)

Indonesia now offers an electronic VOA that you can purchase online before your flight at [molina.imigrasi.go.id](https://molina.imigrasi.go.id). Same cost, but you skip the payment line at the airport and go straight to immigration. Highly recommended.

### Visa-Free Entry

Some ASEAN countries qualify for visa-free entry for 30 days. This is not extendable. If there is any chance you want to stay longer than 30 days, pay for the VOA instead.

### Longer Stays

For stays beyond 60 days, you will need a B211 visa (social/cultural visa), which requires a sponsor and can be arranged through a visa agent in Bali. Budget around $200-300 for the agent fee plus the visa cost.

## Money and Costs

### Currency

Indonesia uses the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). The exchange rates as of early 2026 hover around:

- 1 USD = ~16,000 IDR
- 1 AUD = ~10,000 IDR
- 1 GBP = ~20,000 IDR
- 1 EUR = ~17,000 IDR

The large numbers take a day or two to get used to. A 500,000 note is about $31. A 50,000 note is about $3.

### ATMs and Cards

- **ATMs:** Use machines at official bank branches (BCA, Mandiri, BRI, CIMB Niaga). Avoid standalone ATMs in tourist areas — they are more prone to skimmers.
- **Withdrawal limits:** Most ATMs cap at 2,500,000 IDR per transaction (about $155). BCA machines sometimes allow 3,000,000.
- **Cards:** Visa and Mastercard are accepted at most hotels, restaurants, and shops in tourist areas. Many smaller warungs and local businesses are cash only.
- **Notify your bank:** Tell your bank you are traveling to Indonesia before you leave, or you risk having your card blocked.

### How Much Does Bali Cost?

Bali can be incredibly cheap or surprisingly expensive, depending on your style:

**Budget ($30-50/day per person):**
- Guesthouse: $10-20/night
- Local warung meals: $2-4 each
- Scooter rental: $4-7/day
- Local activities at local prices

**Mid-Range ($80-150/day per person):**
- Nice hotel or villa: $40-80/night
- Mix of local and western restaurants: $5-15 per meal
- [Private driver](/activities/private-driver/): $40-60/day (split between travelers)
- Guided activities and tours

**Luxury ($200+/day per person):**
- Premium villa or resort: $150-500+/night
- Fine dining: $30-80 per meal
- Private tours with premium vehicles
- Beach clubs, spa packages, helicopter tours

### Tipping

Tipping is not mandatory in Bali, but it is appreciated:

- **Restaurants:** 5-10% if no service charge is included (many add 10-15% automatically — check the bill)
- **Drivers:** 50,000-100,000 IDR for a full day
- **Guides:** 50,000-100,000 IDR per person
- **Spa/massage:** 20,000-50,000 IDR
- **Hotel staff:** 10,000-20,000 IDR for porters, housekeeping

## Getting Around Bali

### Private Driver

The best way to explore Bali, especially for first-timers. A [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) costs $40-60 per day for 8-10 hours, comes with an air-conditioned car, and gives you flexibility to change plans on the fly. For groups of two or more, this is often cheaper than ride-hailing apps and infinitely more convenient.

Gede can arrange a trusted driver for your entire trip — or he will drive you himself.

### Ride-Hailing Apps (Grab and Gojek)

Both apps work well in most parts of Bali. Rides are cheap — a 20-minute trip typically costs $2-4. However:

- **Banned zones:** Grab and Gojek are officially restricted in some tourist areas (parts of Ubud, Sanur, Nusa Dua) due to agreements with local taxi cooperatives. Drivers may ask you to walk to a nearby pickup point.
- **Surge pricing:** During peak hours and holidays, prices spike significantly.
- **Motorbike option:** Both apps offer motorbike rides (Go-Ride/GrabBike), which are faster and cheaper but require a helmet and some nerve in Bali traffic.

### Scooter Rental

The most popular way to get around for experienced riders. Scooters rent for $4-7 per day or $60-100 per month.

**Important warnings:**
- An International Driving Permit (IDP) with a motorcycle endorsement is technically required. Police occasionally set up checkpoints and fine riders without one (200,000-500,000 IDR).
- Bali's roads can be chaotic — potholes, dogs, ceremonial processions appearing from side streets, and traffic patterns that follow local logic rather than marked lanes.
- If you have never ridden a scooter before, Bali is not the place to learn. Hire a driver instead.
- Many travel insurance policies do not cover scooter accidents unless you have the proper license.

### Airport Transfers

Pre-book a transfer through your hotel or Gede to avoid the taxi hustle at the airport. Typical costs:

- To [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/): $12-18
- To [Canggu](/areas/canggu/): $15-22
- To [Ubud](/areas/ubud/): $25-35
- To [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/): $15-20

## Safety in Bali

Bali is one of the safest destinations in Southeast Asia. Violent crime against tourists is extremely rare. That said, here are the things to be aware of:

### Common Concerns

- **Petty theft:** Bag snatching from motorbikes happens occasionally, especially in busy areas at night. Carry bags on the side away from the road, or use a crossbody bag.
- **Scams:** Common ones include money changers who short-change you (use ATMs instead), taxi drivers who "forget" to use the meter (use Grab/Gojek or pre-arrange transport), and guides at temples who pressure you for inflated donations.
- **Monkeys:** At Uluwatu Temple and the Ubud Monkey Forest, monkeys will grab sunglasses, hats, phones, and anything shiny. Remove these before entering or keep them in a zipped bag.
- **Ocean currents:** Bali's beaches can have strong rip currents, especially during wet season. Swim at patrolled beaches and between the flags. Beaches at [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/) and parts of the west coast are particularly powerful.

### Health

- **Drink bottled water only.** Never drink tap water in Bali. Ice in restaurants is generally fine (it is factory-produced), but be cautious at very small roadside stalls.
- **Bali belly:** Stomach issues affect many visitors in the first few days. Start with cooked foods, avoid raw salads at basic warungs, and carry Imodium.
- **Mosquitoes:** Dengue fever exists in Bali. Use repellent, especially at dawn and dusk. Malaria risk is very low in the main tourist areas.
- **Pharmacies:** Kimia Farma and Guardian are reliable pharmacy chains. For serious medical issues, BIMC Hospital in Kuta and Siloam Hospital in Denpasar are the best-equipped facilities.
- **Travel insurance:** Absolutely essential. Make sure it covers medical evacuation, as serious cases may require transfer to Singapore or Australia.

## Balinese Culture and Etiquette

Bali is a Hindu island in a predominantly Muslim country, and religion is deeply woven into daily life. Understanding a few cultural basics will enrich your experience enormously.

### Ceremonies and Offerings

You will see small woven baskets filled with flowers, rice, and incense on every sidewalk, doorstep, and dashboard. These are called *canang sari* — daily offerings to the gods. **Do not step on them.** Walk around them, even if it means stepping into the road briefly.

Bali has ceremonies almost every day. Major ones (like Galungan, Kuningan, or Nyepi) may affect your travel plans — roads close, businesses shut, or in the case of Nyepi (the Day of Silence), the entire island shuts down for 24 hours including the airport.

### Temple Etiquette

- Wear a sarong and sash to enter any temple. Most temples provide these at the entrance, but carrying your own is polite.
- Cover your shoulders — no tank tops or sleeveless shirts.
- Women who are menstruating are traditionally asked not to enter temples.
- Do not stand higher than a priest or shrine.
- Do not point your feet at people or sacred objects.
- Ask before photographing ceremonies or priests.

### General Etiquette

- **Use your right hand** for giving and receiving things. The left hand is considered unclean.
- **Dress modestly** when away from the beach. Swimwear is for the pool and beach only.
- **Bargain respectfully** at markets. Start at about 40-50% of the asking price and work toward a middle ground. But remember: the difference between their price and yours might be $2, and it matters more to them than to you.
- **Learn a few words of Bahasa Indonesia.** *Terima kasih* (thank you), *permisi* (excuse me), and *selamat pagi* (good morning) go a long way.

## Best Time to Visit Bali

### Dry Season (April to October)

The most popular time to visit. Expect sunny days, low humidity, and warm temperatures around 27-30 degrees Celsius. The downside: higher prices, bigger crowds, and accommodation books up fast.

**Peak within the peak:** July and August are the busiest months. Book accommodation and popular activities well in advance.

### Wet Season (November to March)

Rain falls almost daily, but usually in intense afternoon downpours that clear within an hour or two. Mornings are often beautiful. The advantages: lower prices, fewer tourists, lush green landscapes, and better hotel availability.

**The worst of it:** January and February tend to have the most rain. But even then, plenty of travelers have amazing trips.

### Shoulder Months (April, May, September, October)

The sweet spot. Good weather, manageable crowds, and reasonable prices. If you have flexibility on dates, aim for these months.

## What to Pack for Bali

### Essentials

- **Lightweight, breathable clothing** — cotton and linen are your friends
- **A sarong** — useful for temples, beach cover-up, and as a towel in a pinch
- **Reef-safe sunscreen** — SPF 50+, and apply generously
- **Insect repellent** — DEET-based for effectiveness, or natural alternatives
- **A rain jacket or compact umbrella** — especially in wet season
- **Comfortable walking shoes** — temple stairs, waterfall hikes, and uneven sidewalks
- **Flip-flops or sandals** — for the beach, pool, and casual walking
- **A dry bag** — for [rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/), boat trips, and waterfall visits
- **Power adapter** — Indonesia uses Type C and F plugs (European-style, 230V)

### Often Forgotten

- **A headlamp or small flashlight** — essential for the [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) and power outages
- **Motion sickness tablets** — for winding mountain roads and boat trips to Nusa Penida
- **Basic first aid kit** — band-aids, antiseptic, painkillers, antihistamine, rehydration salts
- **Cash in small denominations** — for temple donations, parking fees, and small purchases
- **A water bottle with filter** — reduce plastic waste (Bali has a serious plastic problem)

## Connectivity and SIM Cards

Wi-Fi is widely available at hotels, cafes, and restaurants throughout tourist areas. For mobile data, buy a local SIM card:

- **Where:** Official Telkomsel, XL, or Indosat shops (avoid street vendors who may sell expired or fake cards)
- **Cost:** 50,000-150,000 IDR ($3-10) for a SIM with 10-30 GB of data
- **Best provider:** Telkomsel has the widest coverage, including in remote areas
- **Requirements:** You may need to show your passport for registration

Alternatively, buy an eSIM before you arrive if your phone supports it. Airalo and Holafly both offer Indonesia eSIM packages.

## Common Mistakes First-Timers Make

1. **Trying to see too much.** Bali is small on a map but large in travel time. Pick a few areas and go deep rather than racing around the entire island.
2. **Only staying in the south.** [Ubud](/areas/ubud/), [Lovina](/areas/lovina/), and east Bali are completely different worlds worth experiencing.
3. **Not carrying cash.** Many amazing local warungs, small shops, and temples are cash only.
4. **Skipping the cultural side.** The temples, ceremonies, and Balinese Hindu traditions are what make this island unique. A beach is a beach, but a Kecak Fire Dance at sunset over the Indian Ocean only happens here.
5. **Booking everything through hotel concierges.** Hotel markups on tours and activities can be 2-3 times higher than booking directly through a local like Gede.
6. **Underestimating the sun.** You are close to the equator. The UV index in Bali is extreme. Wear sunscreen, reapply often, and do not fall asleep on the beach without shade.
7. **Exchanging money at street changers.** The rates look incredible because they are scams. Use ATMs at bank branches.

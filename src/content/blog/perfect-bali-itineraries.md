Planning a Bali trip is exciting until you realize how much there is to see and how spread out it all is. The island is only about 140 kilometers wide, but Bali's roads, one-lane bridges, and ceremonial processions mean a 50-kilometer drive can take two hours. Choosing the wrong order for your stops can waste entire half-days sitting in traffic.

These itineraries are built around geography, not wishlists. Each day groups activities and areas that are actually close to each other, so you spend your time experiencing Bali rather than staring at the back of a truck.

## How to Use These Itineraries

Each plan is designed to flow logically from south to central to north (or vice versa), minimizing backtracking. They assume you are staying in flexible accommodation or willing to switch bases for longer trips. If you are staying in one place the whole time, a [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) makes everything work.

A few ground rules that apply to every itinerary:

- **Start early.** Bali's best moments happen before 9 AM — fewer crowds, cooler temperatures, better light.
- **Build in downtime.** You are on holiday. Not every hour needs to be scheduled.
- **Stay flexible.** Ceremonies, weather, and traffic can shift plans. That is normal here.

## 3-Day Itinerary: The Bali Highlights Sprint

Three days is tight, but you can absolutely hit the essentials. This itinerary is ideal for a stopover or a weekend extension from somewhere else in Southeast Asia.

### Day 1: South Bali — Beaches, Cliffs, and Sunset

**Morning:** Arrive and settle into your accommodation in [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) or [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/). If you arrived the night before, start with breakfast at a beachfront cafe.

**Afternoon:** Head to Uluwatu Temple, perched on a dramatic 70-meter cliff above the Indian Ocean. The temple grounds are home to a colony of long-tailed macaques — hold your belongings tight. Explore the cliff paths and take in the views.

**Evening:** Stay for the Kecak Fire Dance at sunset. This is one of Bali's most powerful cultural performances — fifty men chanting in unison as dancers tell the Ramayana story against a backdrop of the setting sun. Afterwards, grab seafood at Jimbaran Bay where restaurants line the beach with tables in the sand.

### Day 2: Ubud — Culture, Rice Terraces, and Waterfalls

**Early Morning:** Drive to [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) (about 1.5 hours from the south). Stop at Tegenungan Waterfall on the way — arrive before 9 AM to beat the crowds.

**Late Morning:** Visit the Tegallalang Rice Terraces. Walk the paths through the paddies, grab a coffee at one of the cafes overlooking the valley, and take your time.

**Afternoon:** Explore the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, then wander through Ubud's art market and royal palace area. If you are interested in Balinese crafts, the surrounding villages of Mas (woodcarving), Celuk (silver), and Batuan (painting) are worth a detour.

**Evening:** Catch a traditional Legong dance performance at Ubud Palace, then have dinner at one of Ubud's excellent farm-to-table restaurants.

### Day 3: Water Activities and Departure

**Morning:** Choose your adventure — [white water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/) on the Ayung River near Ubud (Class II rapids, scenic and suitable for beginners) or a [coffee plantation tour](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/) in the highlands.

**Afternoon:** Head back toward the airport area. Stop at Tanah Lot temple for photos if time allows. Spend your final hours at a beach club in [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) — Potato Head and La Brisa are both excellent — before your flight.

## 5-Day Itinerary: The Essentials Done Right

Five days lets you experience the core of Bali without rushing. You will cover the south, the cultural heartland, and have time for a proper adventure.

### Day 1: Arrival and South Bali

**Afternoon:** Settle into [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) or [Canggu](/areas/canggu/). Explore your neighborhood on foot — browse boutiques, find a good local warung (small restaurant), and get your bearings.

**Evening:** Sunset drinks at a beach club. In Seminyak, try Potato Head. In Canggu, The Lawn or La Brisa set the tone perfectly for the trip ahead.

### Day 2: Uluwatu and the Bukit Peninsula

**Morning:** Drive to [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/). Visit Padang Padang Beach (the one from the movie "Eat Pray Love") and swim in its sheltered cove.

**Afternoon:** Explore the clifftop [temples](/activities/temple-tours/) at Uluwatu. If you are a surfer, the reef breaks here are world-class.

**Evening:** Kecak Fire Dance at sunset, then dinner at Single Fin or one of the clifftop restaurants.

### Day 3: Ubud Immersion

**Morning:** Drive to [Ubud](/areas/ubud/). Visit Tirta Empul, the sacred water temple where you can participate in a traditional purification ceremony. This is a genuinely moving experience regardless of your spiritual background.

**Late Morning:** Tegallalang Rice Terraces and a [cooking class](/activities/cooking-classes/) where you will visit a local market and learn to prepare five or six traditional Balinese dishes.

**Afternoon:** Sacred Monkey Forest, then free time to explore Ubud's galleries, cafes, and craft shops.

**Evening:** Stay overnight in Ubud. The town has a completely different energy at night — quieter, cooler, and magical.

### Day 4: Adventure Day

**Early Morning:** [Mount Batur Sunrise Trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) — wake up at 2 AM, hike an active volcano in the dark, and watch the sunrise over the caldera lake from 1,717 meters. Breakfast is cooked using volcanic steam at the summit. This is the single most unforgettable experience on the island.

**Afternoon:** After descending, soak in the natural hot springs near Lake Batur. Your legs will thank you. Then visit a [coffee plantation](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/) in the Kintamani highlands on the drive back.

**Evening:** Return to your south Bali base. Rest — you earned it.

### Day 5: Flex Day and Departure

**Morning:** Use this day for whatever called to you most. Options include [ATV riding](/activities/atv-quad-biking/) through rice paddies, a [waterfall tour](/activities/waterfall-tours/) to the ones you missed, a [surfing lesson](/activities/surfing-lessons/) in Canggu, or a morning of [spa treatments](/activities/spa-wellness/).

**Afternoon:** Last-minute shopping, final beach time, then head to the airport.

## 7-Day Itinerary: The Complete Bali Experience

A week is the sweet spot for most travelers. You get everything from the five-day plan plus time for deeper exploration, a day trip to another island, and genuine relaxation.

### Days 1-4: Follow the 5-Day Itinerary Above

Cover the south, Uluwatu, Ubud, and the Mount Batur sunrise trek as described.

### Day 5: Nusa Penida Day Trip

**Full Day:** Catch an early morning fast boat from Sanur to [Nusa Penida](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/) (about 45 minutes). This rugged island off Bali's southeast coast has some of the most dramatic coastal scenery in Indonesia.

Must-sees: Kelingking Beach (the T-Rex shaped cliff), Angel's Billabong (a natural infinity pool), Broken Beach (a natural rock archway over turquoise water), and Crystal Bay for snorkeling with manta rays.

**Evening:** Return to Bali by late afternoon boat. Rest in Sanur or head back to your base.

### Day 6: North Bali

**Early Morning:** Drive to [Lovina](/areas/lovina/) in north Bali (about 3 hours from the south, but through beautiful mountain scenery). Stop at Gitgit or Sekumpul [waterfall](/activities/waterfall-tours/) on the way.

**Afternoon:** Explore the quieter side of Bali — Banjar Hot Springs, Buddhist temples, and black sand beaches where you might be the only tourist.

**Evening:** Stay overnight in Lovina for the early morning dolphin trip.

### Day 7: Dolphins, Departure

**Early Morning:** [Dolphin watching](/activities/dolphin-watching/) in Lovina — boats depart at dawn to spot wild spinner dolphins in the Bali Sea. Sighting rates are high, especially in dry season.

**Late Morning:** Drive back south via the scenic mountain route through Bedugul and Lake Bratan, stopping at Ulun Danu Beratan temple (the famous lake temple that appears on the 50,000 rupiah note).

**Afternoon:** Final shopping, packing, and departure.

## 10-Day Itinerary: Going Deeper

Ten days lets you move at a more Balinese pace — slower, more intentional, with room for spontaneity and repeat visits to places you loved.

### Days 1-7: Follow the 7-Day Itinerary

Complete the full week covering south Bali, Ubud, Mount Batur, Nusa Penida, and North Bali.

### Day 8: East Bali

**Morning:** Drive to the Sidemen Valley in east Bali. This is the Bali that existed before the tourist boom — terraced rice fields cascading down volcanic slopes, traditional villages where daily offerings are still made at every doorstep, and Mount Agung towering over everything.

**Afternoon:** Visit Tirta Gangga, the beautiful water palace with ornamental ponds and stepping stones across fish-filled pools. Then head to Amed for [snorkeling](/activities/snorkeling-diving/) along the coast — the coral gardens here are accessible right off the beach.

**Evening:** Stay in east Bali. Accommodations here tend to be quieter and more affordable, with jaw-dropping volcano views.

### Day 9: Underwater World and Temples

**Morning:** Drive to Tulamben (about 30 minutes from Amed) for [snorkeling or diving](/activities/snorkeling-diving/) at the USAT Liberty shipwreck. This World War II cargo ship sits in shallow water and is covered in coral, sponges, and teeming with marine life. Even snorkelers can see it clearly.

**Afternoon:** Visit Lempuyang Temple, known as the "Gates of Heaven" — the iconic shot where the temple gate frames Mount Agung in the background. Go early or late afternoon to avoid the longest queues. Then head to Besakih, Bali's largest and holiest temple complex on the slopes of Mount Agung.

**Evening:** Return to south Bali or stay in the east for another night.

### Day 10: [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) and Farewell

**Morning:** Spend your final morning in [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/), Bali's best-kept secret. Walk through the rice fields, have breakfast at a quiet cafe, and experience what Canggu felt like ten years ago.

**Afternoon:** Final [spa session](/activities/spa-wellness/), last-minute shopping at Seminyak's boutiques, and a farewell sunset on the beach.

## 14-Day Itinerary: The Full Island Deep Dive

Two weeks means you can truly know Bali. You will visit every region, try every major activity, and still have days where you do nothing at all. This is the itinerary for people who want to fall in love with the island.

### Days 1-10: Follow the 10-Day Itinerary

Complete everything above at a comfortable pace.

### Day 11: West Bali

**Morning:** Drive to Jatiluwih Rice Terraces in Tabanan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These terraces are far more expansive and peaceful than Tegallalang, with walking trails that wind through the paddies for kilometers.

**Afternoon:** Continue to West Bali National Park (Taman Nasional Bali Barat). This protected area covers mountains, mangroves, and savanna. Arrange a trek or boat trip to Menjangan Island for some of Bali's best wall diving and pristine snorkeling.

**Evening:** Stay in the west — accommodations are sparse but the isolation is the point.

### Day 12: Activities You Have Been Wanting to Try

This is your free day for everything you have been eyeing but have not done yet:

- [ATV quad biking](/activities/atv-quad-biking/) through jungle and rice terraces
- A full-day [cycling tour](/activities/cycling-tours/) from Kintamani to Ubud
- [Deep sea fishing](/activities/fishing-charters/) off the south coast
- A second trip to your favorite waterfall for a longer swim
- [Paintball](/activities/paintball/) if you are traveling with a group

### Day 13: Revisit Your Favorites

Go back to the place that captured you most. For most people, that is Ubud or Uluwatu. Spend the day with no schedule — wander, eat, swim, read. This is the day that will make you consider extending your trip or coming back.

### Day 14: Slow Morning and Departure

**Morning:** Sleep in. Have a long breakfast. Do some last shopping for gifts and souvenirs. Visit a local warung one more time for the nasi campur you have been craving.

**Afternoon:** Head to the airport with plenty of buffer time. Bali traffic near Ngurah Rai can be unpredictable, so leave at least 2 hours from Seminyak or Canggu.

## Tips That Apply to Every Itinerary

**Accommodation strategy for longer trips:** Do not stay in one place the whole time. Moving your base from south (Seminyak/Canggu) to central (Ubud) to north (Lovina) and back dramatically cuts down on driving time.

**Booking transport:** A [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) for the day costs $40-60 and is the single best value in Bali. They know the roads, the shortcuts, and the best places to stop. For a group of two or more, it is cheaper than ride-hailing apps.

**Temple etiquette:** Wear a sarong and sash (provided at most temples). Cover your shoulders. Do not stand higher than a priest or shrine. Do not point your feet at offerings. Women who are menstruating are traditionally asked not to enter temples.

**Weather planning:** Dry season (April to October) is ideal but busy. Wet season (November to March) brings afternoon rain showers that usually clear within an hour or two — mornings are often beautiful, and everything is green and lush.

Canggu went from a sleepy surf village to Bali's most talked-about neighborhood in under a decade. What used to be nothing but rice paddies and a handful of surf shacks now sits alongside trendy cafes, coworking spaces, beach clubs, and some of the best restaurants on the island. But here is the thing most guides won't tell you: Canggu hasn't lost its soul. You just need to know where to look.

This guide covers everything worth doing in Canggu — whether you're a surfer chasing waves, a digital nomad hunting the perfect workspace, a foodie on a mission, or a traveler who just wants to soak it all in.

## Surfing in Canggu

Canggu is Bali's surf capital, and the coastline delivers waves for every level. The main breaks stretch along a few kilometers of black sand beach, each with its own character.

### Batu Bolong Beach

This is where most people start. Batu Bolong is Canggu's most social beach — longboarders, beginners taking lessons, and experienced surfers all share the lineup. The wave is forgiving and fun, breaking over sand with enough push to keep things interesting. The beach itself is lined with warungs (local restaurants) where you can grab a cold Bintang and watch the sunset after your session.

If you've never surfed before, this is the spot to [book a lesson](/activities/surfing-lessons/). Instructors are plentiful and the wave is as beginner-friendly as it gets.

### Echo Beach

A ten-minute walk north from Batu Bolong, Echo Beach is where things get more serious. The wave here is faster, hollower, and breaks over reef at low tide. It's best suited for intermediate to advanced surfers, though on smaller days it can be approachable for confident beginners.

Echo Beach also has the best sunset-watching setup in Canggu. The bars and restaurants right on the sand fill up every evening, and the view of surfers silhouetted against an orange sky is genuinely hard to beat.

### Berawa Beach

South of Batu Bolong, Berawa is slightly less crowded and has a decent beach break that works well at mid-to-high tide. Finns Beach Club sits here, and the vibe is a bit more upscale. It's a good option if you want a surf session followed by a pool day without traveling far.

### Pererenan Beach

Just north of Echo Beach, [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) is Canggu's quieter neighbor. The beach break here is powerful and best for experienced surfers, but the stretch of sand is far less crowded. If the main Canggu breaks feel too busy, Pererenan is a short scooter ride away and feels like a different world.

**Board rental** runs about $5-10 per day throughout Canggu. If you're taking lessons, expect to pay $25-40 for a two-hour session with equipment included.

## Beach Clubs and Day Clubs

Canggu's beach club scene is one of the best in Bali. These aren't just places to drink — they're full-day experiences with pools, DJs, food, and killer views.

### Finns Beach Club

The biggest and most established beach club in Canggu, sitting right on Berawa Beach. Multiple pools, a huge open-air venue, regular international DJs, and solid food. Day beds and VIP areas are available but book fast on weekends. The attached Finns Recreation Club has a waterslide park, trampoline zone, bowling alley, and gym — good for families or anyone who needs a break from the beach.

### La Brisa

An eco-chic beach club built almost entirely from reclaimed boats and driftwood. La Brisa sits on Echo Beach and has a more rustic, bohemian atmosphere compared to Finns. The seafood is excellent, the cocktails are creative, and the whole place looks like it belongs in a design magazine. Gets packed at sunset, so arrive early if you want a good spot.

### The Lawn

A Batu Bolong institution. The Lawn is more low-key than the mega clubs — think grass terraces overlooking the surf break, a solid cocktail list, and a relaxed vibe that works from afternoon into evening. It's one of the best spots to watch the sunset without fighting for a table.

### Atlas Beach Club

One of Canggu's newer additions and already making waves. Massive venue with a lagoon pool, multiple bars, and big-name DJ events. It leans more toward the party crowd, especially on weekends.

## Cafes and Coworking

The cafe culture in Canggu is world-class. Competition is fierce, which means the quality of coffee, food, and workspace is consistently high.

### Top Cafes for Coffee and Breakfast

- **Crate Cafe** — The original Canggu brunch spot. Long lines on weekends, but the food is worth it. Great smoothie bowls and specialty coffee.
- **Hungry Bird** — Excellent specialty coffee, generous portions, fast Wi-Fi. A favorite among remote workers.
- **Nude** — Health-focused menu, beautiful interior, strong coffee program.
- **Machinery** — Industrial-chic space with specialty roasts and a solid all-day menu.
- **Monsieur Spoon** — French bakery with croissants that rival what you'd find in Paris. Multiple locations throughout Canggu.

### Coworking Spaces

Canggu is one of the top digital nomad destinations in the world, and the coworking infrastructure reflects that.

- **Dojo Bali** — The original Canggu coworking space and still one of the best. Pool, fast internet, community events, right in the heart of Canggu.
- **Outpost** — More polished and professional. Private offices available. Good if you need meeting rooms or a quieter environment.
- **BWork** — Budget-friendly option with reliable Wi-Fi and a social atmosphere.

Day passes run $10-20 at most spaces, with monthly memberships from $100-200. Wi-Fi speeds generally sit between 50-100 Mbps.

## Food and Restaurants

Canggu punches well above its weight when it comes to dining. The restaurant scene covers everything from $2 local warungs to upscale fine dining.

### Local Warungs (Budget Eats)

Don't skip the local spots. A plate of nasi campur or mie goreng from a proper warung will run you $1.50-3 and often tastes better than the fancy stuff. Look for places packed with locals — that's always a good sign.

- **Warung Dandelion** — Beloved by locals and expats. Home-cooked Indonesian dishes at fair prices.
- **Warung Bu Mi** — Tiny spot with incredible nasi campur. Cash only.

### Mid-Range Restaurants

- **Shady Shack** — Vegetarian and vegan food done right. Great smoothie bowls and the garden seating is peaceful.
- **Betelnut** — Healthy Mexican-inspired food. The burritos are enormous.
- **Ji Terrace** — Multi-level restaurant with rice field views. The food spans Asian cuisines and it's one of the most photogenic spots in Canggu.

### Special Occasion

- **Mason** — Fine dining meets Canggu cool. French-Asian menu, intimate atmosphere, and a cocktail bar that could hold its own in any major city.
- **Fishbone Local** — Upscale seafood on the beach. Fresh catch, wood-fired cooking, and sunset views.

## Rice Field Walks

One of the most underrated things to do in Canggu is simply walking through the rice paddies. Despite the development, Canggu still has large stretches of active rice terraces weaving between the neighborhoods.

The best route starts near the Shortcut road (the path connecting Batu Bolong to Berawa) and winds through bright green paddies. Early morning is the best time — the light is soft, farmers are working the fields, and you'll have the paths mostly to yourself. The walk takes 30-60 minutes depending on how far you go and how many photos you stop for.

For a longer rice field experience, head just north to [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) where the paddies are more extensive and undisturbed.

## Temples and Culture

Canggu has its own share of temples, and visiting them is a good way to connect with the Balinese culture that still underpins everything here.

### Tanah Lot Temple

Technically just outside Canggu, Tanah Lot is one of Bali's most iconic [temples](/activities/temple-tours/). The sea temple sits on a rock formation just offshore, and at sunset the silhouette against the sky is spectacular. It's a major tourist draw, so arrive at least an hour before sunset to secure a good vantage point.

**Entry:** Around $3 per person
**Best time:** 5-6 PM for sunset

### Pura Batu Bolong

A smaller temple right on the Batu Bolong headland, overlooking the surf break. It's not as dramatic as Tanah Lot, but it's free to visit and the combination of temple, ocean, and surfers makes for a uniquely Canggu scene.

## Fitness and Wellness

Beyond surfing and yoga, Canggu has a serious fitness scene.

### Yoga Studios

- **Samadi Bali** — Daily classes in a beautiful open-air shala. Strong community vibe. Also has an organic market on Sundays.
- **The Practice** — More traditional yoga in a peaceful setting. Good for anyone wanting a break from the Canggu hustle.
- **Desa Seni** — A village resort with daily yoga classes open to non-guests. The setting alone is worth the visit.

### Gyms and Training

- **Finns Recreation Club** — Full gym, pools, and sports facilities. Day passes available.
- **Canggu Fitness** — Straightforward gym with good equipment and affordable rates.
- **CrossFit Wanderlust** — If you need your WOD fix while traveling.

For deeper relaxation, a [Balinese spa treatment](/activities/spa-wellness/) in Canggu will run you anywhere from $8 for a basic massage at a local salon to $50+ at premium wellness centers.

## Day Trips from Canggu

Canggu's central-west location makes it a solid base for exploring the rest of Bali.

### Ubud

About 90 minutes north. Hit the rice terraces at Tegallalang, explore the Monkey Forest, visit art galleries, and take a [cooking class](/activities/cooking-classes/). Easily done as a day trip or overnight.

### Tanah Lot and Jatiluwih

Combine the famous Tanah Lot temple with the UNESCO-listed Jatiluwih rice terraces for a full day. A [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) for this loop runs about $40-50 for 8 hours.

### Waterfalls

Some of Bali's best [waterfalls](/activities/waterfall-tours/) are 1-2 hours from Canggu. Tegenungan, Tibumana, and Tukad Cepung can all be hit in a single day trip.

### Nusa Penida

Catch a fast boat from Sanur (about an hour from Canggu) and spend a day exploring the dramatic cliffs and beaches of [Nusa Penida](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/). Kelingking Beach, Angel's Billabong, and Crystal Bay are the highlights.

## Nightlife

Canggu's nightlife has grown rapidly, though it's still more relaxed than [Seminyak's](/areas/seminyak/) high-end club scene.

- **Old Man's** — The heart of Canggu nightlife. Cheap drinks, live music, and a rowdy atmosphere that goes late. It's an institution.
- **Gimme Shelter** — Rock and roll bar with a grungy vibe. Pool tables, good music, strong drinks.
- **Pretty Poison** — Skate bowl meets bar. Unique concept that draws a young, energetic crowd.
- **Deus Ex Machina** — Motorcycle workshop by day, restaurant and live music venue by night. The Sunday sessions are legendary.

Most nightlife in Canggu peaks around 10 PM-1 AM. If you want to go later, [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) is a 15-minute ride south.

## Where to Stay in Canggu

Canggu is spread out, so where you base yourself matters.

- **Batu Bolong area** — The heart of it all. Walking distance to the beach, best cafe and restaurant concentration, most social. Can be noisy.
- **Berawa** — Slightly more upscale, closer to Seminyak, less chaotic. Good for couples and families.
- **Echo Beach / Pantai Lima** — More spacious, better value, quieter. You'll need a scooter to get around.
- **Pererenan border** — The quietest option while still being close to Canggu's action. Best if you want peace with proximity.

Budget accommodation starts around $15-25 per night for a decent guesthouse. Mid-range villas with pools go for $50-100. Luxury villas can run $200+ per night.

## Getting Around Canggu

The main options for getting around:

- **Scooter** — By far the most common way to navigate Canggu. Rental is $4-7 per day. Only ride if you're experienced — Canggu traffic is hectic and the roads have potholes.
- **Grab/Gojek** — Ride-hailing apps work in Canggu, though drivers can be scarce during peak hours and some areas have restrictions.
- **Walking** — Possible within the Batu Bolong core, but Canggu is too spread out to walk between neighborhoods comfortably.
- **[Private driver](/activities/private-driver/)** — Best for day trips and airport transfers. Not practical for bouncing between cafes and beaches within Canggu itself.

## Practical Tips

- **ATMs:** Stick to bank ATMs (BCA, Mandiri) inside proper branches. Standalone ATMs on the street have a higher risk of skimming.
- **Cash vs. card:** Most established restaurants and cafes accept cards. Warungs, market vendors, and some smaller shops are cash only.
- **Internet:** Canggu has some of the best internet in Bali. Most cafes offer free Wi-Fi, and coworking spaces guarantee fast speeds.
- **Traffic:** The Canggu-Seminyak road gets brutally congested, especially around 5-7 PM. Plan accordingly or use the back roads.
- **Rainy season:** November through March brings afternoon rain showers. Mornings are usually clear, and the rain cools things down nicely. Crowds thin out significantly.

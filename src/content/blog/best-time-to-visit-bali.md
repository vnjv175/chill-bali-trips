The question every Bali trip starts with: when should I go? The honest answer is that Bali works year-round — this isn't a destination with a dead season. But the timing of your visit affects everything from weather and surf conditions to crowds, prices, and which festivals you might catch.

This guide breaks down every month so you can match your travel dates to what actually matters to you.

## The Two Seasons

Bali has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons:

**Dry Season (April - October)**
- Less rainfall, lower humidity, blue skies most days
- Temperatures around 27-30C (80-86F)
- Best surf conditions on the west and south coasts
- Higher tourist numbers, especially July-August
- Peak pricing for accommodation and activities

**Wet Season (November - March)**
- More frequent rain, higher humidity
- Rain typically falls in intense afternoon/evening bursts, not all day
- Temperatures around 27-33C (80-91F) — actually hotter than dry season
- Fewer tourists, lower prices, easier bookings
- Lush, green landscapes at their most vibrant

Neither season is "bad." The wet season myth — that Bali is a washout from November to March — is one of the biggest misconceptions in Southeast Asian travel. Most rainy season days start sunny, with storms rolling in during the afternoon for 1-3 hours before clearing again. You can absolutely have an incredible trip during wet season.

## Month-by-Month Breakdown

### January

**Weather:** Wet season at its peak. Expect rain most days, usually heavy afternoon downpours lasting 1-3 hours. Mornings are often clear and humid. Occasional multi-day rain events can occur.

**Crowds:** Low. January (after New Year) is one of the quietest months. Restaurants have empty tables, beaches have space, and you won't queue for anything.

**Prices:** Low season rates across the board. Accommodation discounts of 30-50% compared to peak season are common. Great time for luxury hotels on a mid-range budget.

**Best for:** Budget travelers, anyone wanting Bali without crowds, wellness retreats (indoor activities unaffected by rain), [spa and wellness](/activities/spa-wellness/) experiences.

**Watch out for:** Flooding on some roads after heavy rain. Pack a lightweight rain jacket and waterproof bag.

### February

**Weather:** Similar to January. Heaviest rainfall month statistically, though daily patterns remain the same — mornings are usually clear. Humidity is high.

**Crowds:** Very low. Possibly the quietest month of the year.

**Prices:** Lowest of the year. This is peak bargain season.

**Best for:** Extended stays on a budget, [cooking classes](/activities/cooking-classes/) and cultural activities, exploring [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) without tourist congestion, photography (the lush, dramatic landscapes look incredible).

**Notable:** Nyepi (Balinese New Year) sometimes falls in February, depending on the lunar calendar. More on this below.

### March

**Weather:** Wet season starts to taper. Rain frequency begins decreasing, though storms are still common. Humidity remains high.

**Crowds:** Still quiet, picking up slightly toward the end of the month.

**Prices:** Low season rates, with some accommodation beginning to adjust upward for the approaching dry season.

**Best for:** The tail end of budget season with improving weather. A smart time to visit if you're flexible with daily plans.

**Notable:** Nyepi typically falls in March. This is Bali's Day of Silence — for 24 hours, the entire island shuts down. No flights, no driving, no leaving your hotel, no lights. It's a remarkable cultural experience and worth planning around. The night before Nyepi features Ogoh-Ogoh parades with massive demon sculptures.

### April

**Weather:** The transition month. Rainfall drops significantly. Days become sunnier and less humid. Bali starts to feel drier and more comfortable.

**Crowds:** Moderate. Visitor numbers start rising, but it's still well below peak.

**Prices:** Shoulder season pricing. Good value — better weather than wet season at lower prices than peak dry season.

**Best for:** The best balance of weather, crowds, and pricing. Excellent surf starts building on the west coast. Great for [Canggu](/areas/canggu/) and [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/) surf trips. [Waterfall tours](/activities/waterfall-tours/) still benefit from higher water levels.

### May

**Weather:** Dry season arrives. Sunny days, low humidity, comfortable temperatures. Rain is infrequent.

**Crowds:** Growing but still manageable. Busier than April but less intense than July-August.

**Prices:** Transitioning to high season. Prices are up from April but still below peak. Good sweet spot for value.

**Best for:** Almost everything. Great weather for hiking ([Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/)), surfing, beach time, island hopping, and exploring the [areas of Bali](/areas/) without feeling overwhelmed.

### June

**Weather:** Dry and comfortable. Very little rainfall. Cooler evenings in the highlands. Perfect beach weather.

**Crowds:** Increasing. European summer holidays and Australian school holidays start feeding into Bali. [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) beach clubs and popular restaurants start requiring reservations.

**Prices:** High season pricing kicks in. Accommodation, particularly in popular areas, is more expensive and availability tightens.

**Best for:** Outdoor activities across the board. [ATV riding](/activities/atv-quad-biking/), [white water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/), diving trips, and all the adventure activities operate at their best. [Dolphin watching](/activities/dolphin-watching/) in [Lovina](/areas/lovina/) has excellent success rates.

### July

**Weather:** Peak dry season. Reliable sunshine, minimal rain, clear skies. Temperatures around 27-29C. The Bali postcard weather.

**Crowds:** Peak season. Bali's busiest month alongside August. Popular sites get crowded, traffic in southern Bali can be intense, and spontaneous restaurant visits often mean waiting for tables.

**Prices:** Highest of the year. Book accommodation and popular activities well in advance — a month or more for peak-season stays.

**Best for:** Travelers who want guaranteed good weather and don't mind the crowds. Best month for [Nusa Penida day trips](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/) (calmest seas for the crossing). Excellent surf across the entire south and west coast.

**Tip:** Book everything early and consider staying in less touristy areas like [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) or East Bali for a more relaxed experience even during peak season.

### August

**Weather:** Same as July — dry, sunny, reliable.

**Crowds:** Equals or exceeds July as the busiest month. Australian school holidays combine with European peak travel.

**Prices:** Peak pricing continues. Late bookings may struggle to find quality accommodation in popular areas.

**Best for:** Same as July. If traveling in August, plan well ahead and use a local concierge like Chill Bali Trips to secure the best spots.

### September

**Weather:** Still dry, still sunny. Rain remains rare. Many consider September the best weather month — all the sun of July/August with slightly less intensity.

**Crowds:** Noticeably lighter than July-August. The peak wave has passed, but conditions remain excellent.

**Prices:** Dropping from peak. Shoulder season pricing returns, offering better value with peak-quality weather.

**Best for:** Arguably the single best month to visit Bali. Great weather, reduced crowds, reasonable prices, and the island feels more relaxed. Every activity is available and conditions are near-optimal.

### October

**Weather:** End of dry season. Still mostly dry, though occasional showers begin appearing. Humidity starts creeping up.

**Crowds:** Moderate and declining. A comfortable visiting experience without queues or congestion.

**Prices:** Shoulder season. Good deals on accommodation and activities.

**Best for:** Similar value proposition to April — good weather, manageable crowds, fair prices. Last reliable month for dry-season activities. The surf season starts winding down on the west coast.

### November

**Weather:** Wet season begins. Rain frequency increases, usually in afternoon bursts. Humidity rises. Mornings are typically clear and warm.

**Crowds:** Low season begins. Numbers drop off after October.

**Prices:** Low season pricing returns. Deals appear across the board.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious travelers who don't mind afternoon rain. Cultural experiences, [temple tours](/activities/temple-tours/), and food exploration are unaffected by weather. East Bali and the highlands are lush and beautiful.

### December

**Weather:** Wet season, similar to November but with increasing rainfall. Christmas-New Year week is an exception crowd-wise (see below).

**Crowds:** Low for most of December, but the final two weeks (Christmas through New Year) see a dramatic spike. Bali fills up for the holidays, and prices temporarily jump to peak-season levels.

**Prices:** Low season rates through mid-December. December 20-January 5 commands peak pricing, often higher than July-August. Book holiday-period travel months in advance.

**Best for:** Early December is a genuine hidden gem — low crowds, low prices, manageable rain. The Christmas-New Year period is festive and energetic, with parties, special dinners, and a celebratory atmosphere, but it comes at peak pricing and crowds.

## Surf Seasons

If surfing is a priority, seasonality matters more:

- **West and south coasts (Canggu, Uluwatu, Seminyak):** Best swells April-October. The dry season delivers consistent groundswell from the Indian Ocean.
- **East coast (Amed, Sanur, Nusa Dua):** Better November-March, when the wet-season swells wrap around from the east.
- **Year-round:** Beginner-friendly beaches like Batu Bolong and Kuta work all year.

## Festival Calendar

Bali's ceremony calendar follows the Pawukon (210-day) and Saka (lunar) calendars, so dates shift annually. Key events to be aware of:

- **Nyepi (March):** Day of Silence. The island shuts down completely for 24 hours. Plan around it or embrace the unique experience.
- **Galungan and Kuningan (every 210 days):** Ten-day celebration of good over evil. Bamboo penjor poles line every road and temples come alive.
- **Ogoh-Ogoh parades (night before Nyepi):** Massive demon effigies paraded through the streets and burned. Spectacular to witness.
- **Full moon ceremonies (monthly):** Temples hold special ceremonies at every full moon, particularly at Uluwatu and Tanah Lot.

## The Verdict

**Best overall months:** May, June, September, October — great weather, manageable crowds, fair prices.

**Best budget months:** January, February, early November, early December — low prices, empty beaches, rain mostly in the afternoon.

**Best weather guarantee:** July, August — if sunshine is non-negotiable, these deliver. Accept higher prices and crowds.

**Most underrated:** April and October — shoulder months that offer the best of both worlds.

Packing for Bali is simultaneously easy and tricky. Easy because the tropical climate means you won't need much — a week's worth of lightweight clothing fits in a carry-on. Tricky because the variety of activities and settings on the island means you might go from a volcano summit at dawn to a beach club at sunset to a temple ceremony in between, and each demands something different.

Most Bali packing lists online are bloated with unnecessary items or so generic they could apply to any tropical destination. This one is built from experience — what you'll actually use daily, what you'll need for specific activities, what to skip entirely, and what's cheaper and easier to buy once you land.

## The Essentials (Pack These No Matter What)

### Clothing

**Lightweight, quick-dry basics:** Bali is hot and humid year-round (27-33 degrees Celsius). Cotton feels great for about ten minutes, then absorbs sweat and stays damp for hours. Pack synthetic or cotton-blend fabrics that breathe and dry quickly. You'll want:

- 5-7 t-shirts or tank tops
- 2-3 pairs of shorts
- 1-2 pairs of lightweight long pants (for temples and evening restaurants)
- 7+ pairs of underwear (quick-dry if you have them)
- 2-3 swimsuits (you'll be in and out of water constantly, and things don't dry overnight in humid season)
- 1 light cardigan or button-up for air-conditioned restaurants and temples

**A sarong:** You'll need one for temple visits, and it's the most versatile piece of clothing you can bring. It works as a beach cover-up, towel, blanket, modesty wrap, and even a pillow on long drives. That said, temples usually provide sarongs at the entrance, so you can also buy one cheaply in Bali for 50,000-80,000 IDR ($3-5).

**Comfortable walking shoes:** One pair of lightweight sneakers or trail runners for hiking, temple stairs, and rice terrace walks. If you're doing the [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/), proper closed-toe shoes with ankle support are essential — the volcanic rock surface is uneven and loose.

**Sandals with grip:** You'll live in sandals in Bali, but choose ones with actual traction. Smooth-soled flip-flops are a liability on wet temple steps, mossy paths, and rainy-season puddles. Reef, Teva, or similar sport sandals are ideal.

### Sun & Rain Protection

**Reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 50+):** The equatorial sun in Bali is brutal, even on overcast days. Apply generously and reapply every 2 hours when outdoors. Bring reef-safe formulas — Bali's marine ecosystem is under enough pressure without chemical sunscreen runoff.

**Sunglasses with UV protection:** A quality pair with polarized lenses. Bali's light is intense, and you'll be squinting all day without them.

**A hat:** Wide-brimmed sun hat for beach days, a cap for hiking and motorbike riding. Non-negotiable.

**A lightweight rain jacket:** Even in dry season, brief rain showers happen. In wet season (November-March), a packable rain jacket is essential daily gear. Skip the umbrella — you need your hands free when navigating Bali's streets.

### Tech & Documents

**Universal power adapter:** Indonesia uses Type C and Type F outlets (European-style two-pin). Bring an adapter or a universal travel adapter with USB ports.

**Portable battery pack:** A 20,000mAh power bank is worth the weight. Between GPS navigation, Grab rides, Google Translate, and photos, your phone battery won't make it through a full Bali day.

**Waterproof phone case:** Essential for water activities, rainy-season downpours, and waterfall visits. A $15 waterproof pouch is cheaper than replacing your phone.

**Copies of important documents:** Digital and physical copies of your passport, travel insurance, flight bookings, and accommodation confirmations. Store digital copies in your email and cloud storage. Carry physical copies separately from the originals.

### Health & Toiletries

**Mosquito repellent:** DEET-based repellent (30-50%) is the most effective. Apply at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Bali does have dengue — this isn't optional.

**Basic first-aid kit:** Band-aids, antiseptic cream, painkillers, anti-diarrhea medication, rehydration salts, and any prescription medications you need. Pharmacies exist in major towns, but the selection outside tourist areas is limited and labels are in Indonesian.

**Stomach medication:** Bali belly is real and common. Pack Imodium, activated charcoal, or similar. Probiotics started a week before your trip may help prevent it.

**Prescription medications:** Bring enough for your entire trip plus a few extra days, in original packaging with the prescription label. Some medications that are over-the-counter elsewhere require a prescription in Indonesia.

**Reef-safe sunscreen (yes, again):** It's expensive in Bali and the reef-safe varieties are hard to find. Bring your own.

## Activity-Specific Packing

### For Temple Visits

Temples require modest clothing: covered shoulders and knees for both men and women. A sarong around the waist is required at most temples. Some major temples provide sarongs and sashes at the entrance (sometimes free, sometimes for a small fee), but having your own saves hassle. Read our full guide to [temple etiquette and the best temples to visit](/blog/bali-temple-etiquette/).

- Sarong or long skirt/pants
- Top that covers shoulders
- Sash (some temples require this around the waist over the sarong)

### For Water Activities

Whether you're [surfing](/activities/surfing-lessons/), [snorkeling](/activities/snorkeling-diving/), or [white water rafting](/activities/white-water-rafting/), you'll want:

- Rash guard (sun protection and reef/rock protection)
- Water shoes or reef booties (for rocky entries)
- Waterproof camera or GoPro
- Dry bag for valuables

You don't need to bring snorkel gear or surf boards — rental equipment is available everywhere and saves luggage space.

### For Hiking & Trekking

The [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) and [waterfall tours](/activities/waterfall-tours/) need:

- Proper hiking shoes or sturdy sneakers (not sandals)
- Headlamp or torch (for pre-dawn starts)
- Light fleece or jacket (it's cold at altitude before sunrise)
- Small daypack (for water, snacks, camera)

### For Beach Clubs & Nightlife

Bali's beach clubs and upscale restaurants have varying dress codes, but generally:

- Men: collared shirt or clean t-shirt, tailored shorts or chinos, closed shoes or clean sandals
- Women: sundress, jumpsuit, or resort-wear equivalent
- Leave the boardshorts and singlets for the beach — many venues won't admit you in them after sunset

## What NOT to Pack

This list is as important as the packing list. Save the luggage space.

**Heavy towels:** Your accommodation provides them. Beach clubs provide them. Many activity operators provide them. If you want a personal beach towel, buy a thin microfiber travel towel.

**Excessive clothing:** Laundry in Bali costs $1-2 per kilogram and is returned within 24 hours. Pack for 5-7 days regardless of trip length and use laundry services for the rest.

**Expensive jewelry:** Leave it at home. Between the ocean, pools, temples, and general adventure activities, you'll either lose it, damage it, or attract unwanted attention.

**Laptop (unless you're working):** If you're not a digital nomad, leave the laptop. Your phone handles everything you need for a vacation — maps, bookings, photos, communication.

**Dress shoes or heels:** Even Bali's nicest restaurants are tropical-casual. The fanciest footwear you'll need is clean sandals or loafers. Heels are impractical on Bali's uneven streets and temple stairs.

**Books (physical):** Pack a Kindle instead. Physical books add weight and get damaged by humidity. Ubud has excellent secondhand bookshops if you want the physical reading experience.

**A full toiletry bag:** Bali has modern supermarkets (Pepito, Bintang, Coco Mart) with international brands. You can buy shampoo, conditioner, body wash, razors, and most toiletries easily. Only bring specialty items and prescription products from home.

## What to Buy in Bali

Some things are genuinely better and cheaper to buy on arrival:

- **Sarongs:** $3-5 at local markets, infinite variety
- **Bintang singlets and t-shirts:** The classic souvenir/daily wear
- **Cheap sunglasses (backup pair):** Markets sell decent options for $2-5
- **Mosquito repellent coils:** Available at every convenience store, great for villa evenings
- **Aloe vera gel:** For the inevitable sunburn, available at pharmacies and supermarkets
- **Sim card:** Get one at the airport on arrival for data and local calls

## Seasonal Adjustments

### Dry Season (April - October)

The packing list above covers dry season well. Additional notes:
- Less rain gear needed (but still pack a light jacket)
- Lighter clothing is fine — less humidity means things dry faster
- Peak season (July-August) means dressier options for popular restaurants that may be more crowded and selective

### Wet Season (November - March)

Add or adjust the following:
- Upgrade rain jacket to something more substantial (not just a windbreaker)
- Pack a waterproof day bag or backpack
- Extra quick-dry clothing (things take longer to dry in high humidity)
- More mosquito repellent
- Waterproof sandals over standard flip-flops
- Light layers for cooler evenings after rain

## The Carry-On Challenge

It's entirely possible to do Bali with just a carry-on bag. The formula is simple: 5-7 days of lightweight clothing, one pair of versatile shoes, sandals, a rain jacket, swimwear, and your essentials. Use laundry services. Buy toiletries locally. Skip the "just in case" items that take up half your bag but never leave it.

Traveling light in Bali has practical benefits beyond convenience — you can hop between areas more easily, take domestic flights without luggage hassle, and avoid the chaos of Ngurah Rai's baggage carousel.

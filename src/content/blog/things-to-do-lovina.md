Most visitors to Bali never make it north. They land at the airport, shuttle to [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/) or [Canggu](/areas/canggu/), maybe spend a few days in Ubud, and fly home thinking they've seen the island. They haven't. The real Bali — the Bali that existed before the surf schools and beach clubs — is alive and thriving along the north coast, and Lovina is its gateway.

Lovina sits on Bali's northern shore, about three hours from the airport by car. The pace is slower, the prices are lower, the beaches are black volcanic sand, and the ocean is calm rather than pounding. This is where Balinese families go on holiday. It is where travelers who've been to Bali three or four times finally end up, wondering why they didn't come sooner.

Here is everything worth doing in Lovina and the surrounding North Bali region.

## Dolphin Watching

This is what put Lovina on the map, and it remains the area's signature experience. Every morning before dawn, dozens of traditional jukung outrigger boats launch from Lovina's black sand beach and head out to sea in search of wild spinner dolphins.

The dolphins are not penned, trained, or baited — these are genuine wild encounters. Pods of 20 to 100+ dolphins regularly appear, leaping and spinning in the early morning light against a backdrop of the Bali Sea and the mountains of Java visible on the horizon.

### How It Works

Boats depart around 5:30-6:00 AM from the beach in front of Lovina's main strip. The trip lasts 1-2 hours, and most mornings the boats locate dolphin pods within 30 minutes. Sighting success rates during dry season (April-October) are high — roughly 90%.

**Cost:** $10-15 per person for a shared boat
**Book through:** [Chill Bali Trips' dolphin watching experience](/activities/dolphin-watching/) includes pickup, boat trip, and a guide who knows the best spots

### Tips for the Best Experience

- **Go in dry season** — April through October offers the calmest seas and highest dolphin sighting rates.
- **Bring a light layer** — It's cool on the water before sunrise.
- **Manage expectations** — The dolphins are wild. Some mornings they put on an incredible show; other mornings they're more subdued. That's the beauty of it.
- **Choose a responsible operator** — Some boats chase the dolphins aggressively, which stresses the animals. Chill Bali Trips works with captains who maintain respectful distances.

## Waterfalls

North Bali has some of the island's most stunning [waterfalls](/activities/waterfall-tours/), and because the area sees fewer tourists, you'll often have them nearly to yourself.

### Sekumpul Waterfall

Frequently called the most beautiful waterfall in Bali, and it's hard to argue. Sekumpul is actually a cluster of waterfalls cascading down a lush green gorge. Reaching it involves a moderately challenging trek through jungle and rice terraces, crossing a river, and descending steep stairs — but the payoff is extraordinary.

**Distance from Lovina:** 30 minutes by car
**Trek duration:** 45-60 minutes each way
**Entry fee:** ~$3 plus optional local guide ($5-10)

### Gitgit Waterfall

The most accessible waterfall near Lovina and a good option if you don't want a strenuous hike. Gitgit is a single powerful 35-meter drop surrounded by dense tropical forest. The walk from the parking area takes about 15 minutes along a paved path.

**Distance from Lovina:** 20 minutes by car

### Aling-Aling Waterfall

A series of cascading falls where you can actually slide down natural rock waterslides and jump from cliff ledges into the pools below. It's the most fun waterfall experience in Bali, combining beauty with genuine adventure.

**Distance from Lovina:** 40 minutes by car
**Activities:** Natural waterslides, cliff jumping (5m and 15m options)

### Banyumala Twin Waterfalls

Hidden in a valley between rolling hills, Banyumala features two streams of water converging into a natural swimming pool. The trek down is steep but manageable, and the setting is serene. Fewer visitors than Sekumpul, nearly as beautiful.

**Distance from Lovina:** 45 minutes by car

## Hot Springs

North Bali sits in the volcanic highlands, and natural hot springs bubble up throughout the region. Soaking in mineral-rich thermal water surrounded by tropical forest is one of the most relaxing things you can do in Bali.

### Banjar Hot Springs (Air Panas Banjar)

The most famous hot springs in North Bali, set in a lush garden with carved dragon-mouth spouts channeling warm sulfuric water into tiered pools. The temperature is perfect — warm enough to be therapeutic without being uncomfortably hot. The setting is beautiful, with tall trees creating a natural canopy.

**Distance from Lovina:** 15 minutes
**Entry:** ~$2.50 per person
**Tip:** Visit on a weekday morning for the most peaceful experience

### Banyuwedang Hot Springs

Located further west near Menjangan Island, these hot springs sit right on the coast. The water is warmer and more sulfuric than Banjar, and the setting — where mangrove forest meets the sea — is unique.

## Buddhist Monastery

### Brahma Vihara Arama

Bali's largest Buddhist monastery sits on a hillside above Lovina with panoramic views of the north coast. The complex features orange-roofed meditation halls, ornamental gardens, and a miniature replica of Borobudur (Java's famous Buddhist temple). It's a peaceful contrast to the Hindu temples that dominate most of Bali, and the hilltop location offers stunning views.

**Distance from Lovina:** 15 minutes
**Entry:** Donation-based
**Dress code:** Respectful clothing (knees and shoulders covered)

## Snorkeling and Diving

The north coast has calm waters (no big swells like the south) and healthy reef systems, making it excellent territory for [snorkeling and diving](/activities/snorkeling-diving/).

### Menjangan Island

Part of West Bali National Park, Menjangan Island has some of the best wall diving and snorkeling in all of Bali. The reef drops off steeply from the shore, creating dramatic underwater walls covered in soft corals, sea fans, and sponges. Visibility regularly exceeds 30 meters. The island is uninhabited and pristine.

**Distance from Lovina:** About 90 minutes by car plus a 30-minute boat ride
**Best for:** Both snorkeling and diving. Even snorkelers can see the reef dropoff from the surface.

### Lovina Reef

The reef directly off Lovina's beach is decent for casual snorkeling. Fish life is abundant, and the calm waters make it accessible even for non-confident swimmers. Local fishermen will take you out in their jukungs for a few dollars.

### Pemuteran

A dive-focused village about an hour west of Lovina, Pemuteran is home to the Biorock reef restoration project — artificial structures that use low-voltage electricity to promote coral growth. The results are impressive, and diving or snorkeling here feels like visiting an underwater sculpture garden.

## Temples and Culture

North Bali's [temples](/activities/temple-tours/) are older and more atmospheric than many of the famous ones in the south, with far fewer crowds.

### Pura Beji and Pura Dalem Jagaraga

These twin temples in the village of Jagaraga, about 20 minutes from Lovina, are known for their extraordinarily detailed stone carvings. The reliefs include everything from traditional Balinese scenes to quirky depictions of Dutch colonial soldiers and early automobiles — a fascinating cultural record.

### Ulun Danu Bratan

While technically in the highlands rather than Lovina itself, this lake temple is one of Bali's most iconic images — a multi-tiered pagoda appearing to float on the misty waters of Lake Bratan. It's about 90 minutes from Lovina and is easily combined with a highlands day trip.

### Pura Meduwe Karang

A large temple in Kubutambahan (15 minutes east of Lovina) famous for a stone carving of a figure riding a bicycle — believed to be a depiction of a Dutch artist from the early 1900s. The temple is important for agricultural rituals and is far less visited than the southern temples.

## Coffee and Chocolate

The highlands above Lovina are prime growing territory for both coffee and cacao.

### Coffee Plantation Tours

Several plantations in the Munduk and Bedugul highlands offer tours where you can see the entire coffee production process, from cherry to cup. You'll learn about (and taste) various Balinese coffee varieties, including the famous — and controversial — Luwak coffee. The [coffee plantation tour](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/) through Chill Bali Trips includes transport and tastings.

### Chocolate Factory Visits

Bali's craft chocolate scene is growing, and several small-batch producers operate in the North Bali highlands. Tours typically include a walk through cacao groves, a look at the bean-to-bar process, and generous tastings.

## Munduk and the Highlands

The mountain town of Munduk, about 45 minutes above Lovina, is worth a day trip or overnight stay on its own.

### What to Do in Munduk

- **Twin Lakes (Buyan and Tamblingan)** — Two volcanic crater lakes surrounded by cloud forest. Hiring a canoe on Lake Tamblingan and paddling through the mist is genuinely magical.
- **Munduk Waterfall** — An easy jungle walk to a beautiful cascade. Multiple waterfalls in the area can be combined into a half-day trek.
- **Clove and vanilla plantations** — The air in Munduk smells incredible, thanks to the spice plantations that carpet the hillsides.
- **Trekking** — Jungle trails through cloud forest, with the chance to spot rare birds and butterflies.

## Food in Lovina

Lovina's restaurant scene is simpler and more affordable than the south, with an emphasis on fresh seafood and traditional Balinese cooking.

### Seafood

The fishing boats that launch from Lovina's beach every night return with fresh catch every morning. Several beachfront restaurants grill the day's catch to order — whole fish, prawns, squid, and crab, all at prices that would be unthinkable in Seminyak.

Expect to pay $5-10 for a full grilled seafood meal with rice, sambal, and vegetables.

### Warungs

Local warungs line Lovina's main street serving nasi campur, mie goreng, and other Indonesian staples for $1.50-3 per plate. The food is fresh, the portions are generous, and the prices reflect North Bali's much lower cost of living.

### Restaurants

- **The Global Village** — The most varied menu in Lovina, with Indonesian, Thai, and Western options. A long-running expat favorite.
- **Spice Beach Club** — One of the newer additions, bringing a touch of southern Bali polish to the north coast. Good cocktails, good food, beach setting.
- **Jasmine Kitchen** — Thai-Balinese fusion that punches above its weight.

## Where to Stay

Lovina accommodation is remarkably affordable compared to the south.

- **Budget:** Clean guesthouses and homestays from $10-20 per night. Many include breakfast.
- **Mid-range:** Beachfront hotels with pools for $30-60 per night. This is the sweet spot — you get facilities that would cost three times as much in Seminyak.
- **Luxury:** A handful of boutique resorts offer premium experiences for $100-200 per night. Still a fraction of southern Bali luxury prices.

## Getting to Lovina

Lovina is about three hours from the airport or southern Bali by car. The drive takes you through Bali's mountainous interior, past rice terraces, volcanic lakes, and cloud forest — it's one of the most scenic drives on the island.

A [private driver](/activities/private-driver/) for the transfer costs around $40-50 and is the most comfortable option. Gede can arrange the drive with strategic stops at waterfalls, the highland temples, and viewpoints along the way, turning the transfer itself into a half-day experience.

Public transport options are limited and inconvenient. Shared shuttles exist but run on unreliable schedules. For North Bali, a private driver is the way to go.

## Getting Around Lovina

Lovina itself is compact enough that the main strip is walkable. For exploring the wider area (waterfalls, hot springs, Munduk), you'll want either a scooter ($3-5 per day — cheaper than the south) or a driver.

## How Long to Spend

Most visitors underestimate Lovina and allocate just one night. That's enough for dolphins and a waterfall, but to truly experience North Bali — the hot springs, Menjangan, Munduk, the highland temples — plan for at least two to three nights. The pace up here rewards slowing down.

## Let Gede Build Your North Bali Adventure

North Bali is Gede's backyard. He knows the waterfall trails, the best dolphin boat captains, the highland roads, and the warungs where the fishermen eat. A North Bali trip arranged through Chill Bali Trips covers logistics that would take hours to figure out independently — and you'll experience places and moments that solo travelers rarely find.

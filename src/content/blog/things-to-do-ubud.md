Ubud is the cultural and spiritual heartbeat of Bali. Set among lush river valleys and terraced rice paddies in the island's central highlands, it's where Balinese art, dance, spirituality, and cuisine converge in a setting that's as beautiful as anywhere on Earth.

But Ubud has also changed. What was once a quiet artist's village is now a major tourist destination with traffic jams, Instagram crowds, and more yoga studios per capita than anywhere outside of India. The key to loving Ubud is knowing where to go, when to go, and how to get beyond the surface. This guide covers all of it.

## Temples and Spiritual Sites

### Tirta Empul Water Temple

The most powerful temple experience you can have in Ubud — possibly in all of Bali. Tirta Empul is a sacred water temple where Balinese Hindus come to purify themselves by passing through a series of fountains fed by a natural spring. Visitors can participate in the purification ritual, which involves walking through the fountains one by one while offering prayers.

**What to know:**
- You must wear a sarong (available for rent at the entrance)
- Bring a change of clothes — you will get completely soaked
- There's a specific order to the fountains. Follow the locals or ask a guide
- The experience is spiritual, not performative. Be respectful, quiet, and mindful
- Best visited early morning (before 9 AM) when there are fewer visitors

**Cost:** 50,000 IDR ($3 USD) entry
**Location:** Tampaksiring, about 30 minutes north of central Ubud

### Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave)

A 9th-century archaeological site featuring a rock-carved cave entrance in the shape of a demon's mouth, bathing pools, and ancient fountains. The cave itself is small but atmospheric, and the surrounding gardens and pools are beautifully maintained.

**Cost:** 50,000 IDR
**Location:** 5 minutes east of central Ubud
**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes

### Gunung Kawi

One of Bali's oldest and most impressive temple complexes. Ten rock-cut shrines (candi) carved into the cliff face of a lush river valley, dating to the 11th century. The walk down to the temple through rice terraces and tropical forest is beautiful, but the stairs back up are a workout.

**Cost:** 50,000 IDR
**Location:** Tampaksiring, near Tirta Empul — combine them in one trip
**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours including the walk down and back

### Saraswati Temple (Ubud Water Palace)

Right in the center of Ubud, this temple sits behind a lotus pond filled with pink and white water lilies. The temple's stone carvings are exquisite, and the setting — especially when the lotus is in bloom — is one of the most photographed in Ubud.

**Cost:** Free
**Location:** Central Ubud, on Jalan Raya Ubud
**Time needed:** 20-30 minutes
**Tip:** Evening dance performances are sometimes held here. Check the schedule.

### Pura Taman Kemuda Saraswati

Adjacent to the water palace, this temple is often overlooked by tourists focused on the lotus pond photo. Take time to walk through the inner courtyards and appreciate the stone carving work.

## Rice Terraces

### Tegallalang Rice Terraces

The most famous rice terraces in Bali and one of the most visited sites on the island. Dramatic cascading paddies carved into a steep river valley, with palm trees punctuating the layers of green.

**The honest truth:** Tegallalang is beautiful but heavily commercialized. The terraces are lined with photo platforms, swing sets, cafes, and souvenir shops, all of which charge fees. You'll be asked to pay entry at the top (20,000 IDR), and additional fees for walking through certain sections of the terraces where local families control access.

Despite the commercialization, the views are genuinely stunning, especially in the early morning light. Go early (before 8:30 AM) to avoid the worst crowds.

**Location:** 20 minutes north of central Ubud
**Time needed:** 1-2 hours

### Ceking Rice Terrace

Immediately adjacent to Tegallalang, Ceking offers a slightly different perspective on the same valley. Some of the most popular viewpoint restaurants (Tis Cafe, for example) are technically in Ceking rather than Tegallalang.

### Jatiluwih Rice Terraces (Day Trip)

If you want rice terraces without the circus, Jatiluwih in the Tabanan regency is the answer. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the terraces are vast and uncrowded, and the traditional subak irrigation system has been operating here for over a thousand years. It requires a longer drive (about 90 minutes from Ubud), but the experience is far more authentic than Tegallalang.

Consider combining Jatiluwih with a [cycling tour](/blog/cycling-tours-bali/) for the best way to experience the terraces.

## Art and Culture

### Ubud Art Market (Pasar Seni)

Located in the center of town opposite the royal palace, the Ubud Art Market is a sprawling collection of stalls selling paintings, woodcarvings, textiles, jewelry, baskets, and souvenirs. It's touristy by nature, but the quality is generally higher than markets in Kuta or Seminyak.

**Bargaining tips:**
- Start at 30-40% of the first asking price and work toward a middle ground
- Be friendly and smile — aggressive negotiation is culturally off-putting
- Walk away if you can't agree. They'll often call you back with a better price
- Morning (before 9 AM) the market is less crowded and stall owners are sometimes more flexible on price

**Time needed:** 1-2 hours if you enjoy browsing

### ARMA Museum (Agung Rai Museum of Art)

One of the best art museums in Bali. The collection spans traditional Balinese painting, Indonesian contemporary art, and works by foreign artists who lived in Bali — including pieces by Walter Spies and Rudolf Bonnet, the European artists who helped catalyze Ubud's art movement in the 1930s.

The museum grounds are beautiful, set in traditional Balinese architecture with gardens, lily ponds, and a cafe.

**Cost:** 80,000 IDR
**Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

### Neka Art Museum

Another excellent collection focusing on the evolution of Balinese painting from traditional kamasan-style works to modern pieces. The museum is well-curated with English explanations that provide context for each style and period.

**Cost:** 100,000 IDR
**Time needed:** 1-2 hours

### Blanco Renaissance Museum

The former home and studio of Antonio Blanco, an eccentric Spanish-Filipino artist who lived in Ubud from the 1950s until his death in 1999. The museum showcases his colorful, often erotic paintings in a flamboyant setting with gardens and birds. It's a personality-driven museum — you're experiencing Blanco's world rather than a neutral gallery.

**Cost:** 80,000 IDR
**Time needed:** 45 minutes - 1 hour

### Traditional Dance Performances

Ubud is the best place in Bali to see traditional Balinese dance. Multiple venues host nightly performances:

- **Ubud Royal Palace:** Legong and other classical dances performed in the ornate palace courtyard. Nightly at 7:30 PM. Tickets 80,000-100,000 IDR.
- **ARMA Open Stage:** Various traditional dance forms. Check the weekly schedule.
- **Pura Dalem Ubud:** Kecak fire dance performances. Similar to the famous Uluwatu performance but in a temple setting.

**Recommendation:** See at least one performance. The combination of gamelan music, elaborate costumes, and expressive movement is unlike anything you'll experience elsewhere.

## Nature and Outdoor Activities

### Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary

A dense tropical forest in the heart of Ubud that's home to over 1,200 long-tailed macaques. The forest covers 12 hectares and contains three ancient temples, moss-covered stone statues, a dragon bridge, and towering banyan trees.

**What to know:**
- The monkeys are wild but habituated to humans. They can be aggressive, especially around food
- Don't bring food, open bags, or dangling jewelry. Monkeys will grab anything they think they can eat or play with
- Keep a firm grip on sunglasses, hats, and phones. Monkeys steal these regularly
- Don't make direct eye contact or smile showing teeth — monkeys interpret both as aggression
- Despite the warnings, the forest itself is gorgeous and peaceful, and most visitors have no issues

**Cost:** 80,000 IDR
**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours

### Campuhan Ridge Walk

A paved path along a narrow ridge between two river valleys, offering panoramic views of palm trees, tropical vegetation, and the morning mist. It's Ubud's most popular walking route and the closest thing to a nature hike you can do from the town center.

**Best time:** Early morning (6-7 AM) when the light is golden and the temperature is cool. By 9 AM it's hot and crowded.

**Length:** About 2 km one way. Most people walk out and back in 45-60 minutes.

**Cost:** Free
**Starting point:** Near the Warwick Ibah hotel on the western edge of Ubud

### Waterfalls Near Ubud

Ubud is surrounded by waterfalls, ranging from the easily accessible to the genuinely adventurous. The best ones:

**Tegenungan Waterfall:** The most popular and accessible. A broad, powerful waterfall with a swimming area at the base. Easy access via stairs. Crowded but impressive. 20 minutes south of Ubud. Entry: 20,000 IDR.

**Tibumana Waterfall:** A hidden gem in a bamboo forest. Quieter than Tegenungan, with a peaceful swimming hole. 30 minutes east of Ubud. Entry: 15,000 IDR.

**Tukad Cepung Waterfall:** An ethereal experience — the waterfall drops into a cave, and when the morning sun hits the water through the opening, it creates beams of light through the mist. One of the most unique waterfalls you'll ever see. 45 minutes northeast of Ubud. Entry: 15,000 IDR. Best visited between 9-11 AM for the light effect.

**Kanto Lampo Waterfall:** A cascading waterfall over a stepped rock formation that creates a photogenic curtain of water. Popular for Instagram-style photos of people standing in the cascading flow. 20 minutes southeast of Ubud. Entry: 15,000 IDR.

### Cycling Tours

The downhill cycling tours from the Kintamani volcano area to Ubud are among the best-value activities in Bali. You coast through rice terraces, village roads, and tropical forest with minimal effort and maximum scenery. Read our full [cycling tours guide](/blog/cycling-tours-bali/) for details.

## Wellness and Yoga

Ubud is the wellness capital of Southeast Asia. The concentration of yoga studios, spas, healing centers, and wellness retreats is extraordinary.

### Yoga Studios

**The Yoga Barn:** The institution. Multiple daily classes across all styles (vinyasa, hatha, yin, aerial, kundalini). Beautiful space with open-air shalas surrounded by rice paddies. Drop-in classes from 130,000 IDR.

**Radiantly Alive:** A high-quality studio with excellent teachers and a strong community vibe. Classes lean toward dynamic vinyasa and power yoga.

**Intuitive Flow:** A community-focused studio with affordable classes and a welcoming atmosphere for beginners.

### Spas and Massage

Quality massage in Ubud ranges from 80,000 IDR ($5 USD) at local spas to over 1,000,000 IDR ($63 USD) at luxury resort spas. The mid-range sweet spot — 200,000-400,000 IDR ($13-25 USD) — gets you a skilled therapist in a peaceful setting. For a full breakdown, see our [recovery and wellness guide](/blog/recovery-wellness-bali/).

### Wellness Retreats

Multi-day programs combining yoga, meditation, healthy eating, and healing treatments are available throughout the Ubud area. These range from budget-friendly (sharing accommodation, group classes) to premium (private villa, personal instruction, holistic meals).

## Food and Dining

### Must-Try Restaurants

**Locavore:** Fine dining using local Indonesian ingredients. Tasting menu format. Reservations essential. One of the best restaurants in all of Indonesia — not just Ubud.

**Hujan Locale:** By the same team as Locavore, offering a more casual but equally thoughtful take on Indonesian cuisine. Excellent cocktails.

**Naughty Nuri's:** Ubud's legendary warung, famous for its BBQ pork ribs and dirty martinis. The ribs are genuinely excellent and the atmosphere is lively. Expect a wait at peak times.

**Bridges Bali:** A beautiful restaurant spanning a river gorge with outdoor seating overlooking the jungle. The setting is as good as the food — go for sunset.

**Ibu Oka:** The place for babi guling (Balinese suckling pig). Anthony Bourdain featured it on his show, and the reputation is deserved. Simple setting, extraordinary pork.

### Cooking Classes

Learning to cook Balinese food is one of the best activities in Ubud. Most classes start with a morning market visit to buy ingredients, followed by 3-4 hours of hands-on cooking, and conclude with a feast of everything you made.

**Cost:** 250,000-500,000 IDR ($16-32 USD) per person including market visit, ingredients, instruction, and the meal.

**Top options:** Paon Bali, Casa Luna, and Bumbu Bali Cooking School are consistently well-reviewed.

### Coffee Culture

Ubud has a thriving specialty coffee scene. Seniman Coffee Studio is the standout — they roast Indonesian single-origin beans and serve them with barista precision. For a more traditional experience, visit one of the coffee plantations on the road to Kintamani and sample various blends, including the controversial luwak coffee.

## Shopping

### Beyond the Art Market

**Threads of Life:** A textile gallery selling museum-quality handwoven fabrics from across the Indonesian archipelago. Expensive but extraordinary craftsmanship.

**Gaya Ceramic and Design:** Handmade ceramics in contemporary and traditional styles. Beautiful work.

**Kou Cuisine:** High-quality handmade chocolates and confections — perfect for gifts.

**Jalan Dewi Sita and Jalan Hanoman:** These two streets have the highest concentration of interesting shops, cafes, and galleries in central Ubud. Walk both end to end.

## Practical Tips

### Getting Around Ubud

**Walking:** Central Ubud is walkable, though sidewalks are uneven and traffic is heavy on the main roads. Most of the town's restaurants, shops, and galleries are within walking distance of each other.

**Scooter:** The most efficient way to get around if you're comfortable riding. Traffic in central Ubud is slow-moving and chaotic, but speeds are low. 50,000-70,000 IDR per day.

**Private driver:** Essential for visiting attractions outside the town center (rice terraces, waterfalls, temples). Full-day hire runs 500,000-700,000 IDR ($32-44 USD) for 8-10 hours.

**Ride-hailing:** Grab and Gojek work in Ubud but face restrictions in some central areas due to local taxi association agreements. Pickup points may differ from your actual location.

### How Many Days in Ubud

**Minimum:** Two full days to see the major highlights (temples, rice terraces, Monkey Forest, one waterfall, one evening dance performance).

**Ideal:** Three to four days allows you to explore at a relaxed pace, take a cooking class, do a cycling tour, visit the art museums, and still have time for a wellness day.

**Extended stay:** A week or more if you're doing a yoga retreat or want to deeply explore the surrounding villages and countryside.

### When to Visit

Ubud is inland and at a higher elevation than the coast, so it's slightly cooler and gets more rainfall. During wet season (November-March), afternoon rain is almost daily — plan outdoor activities for the morning. The upside is greener landscapes and fewer crowds.

Dry season (April-October) offers more reliable weather but bigger crowds, especially July-August.

### Where to Stay

**Central Ubud (Jalan Raya Ubud, Monkey Forest area):** Walking distance to everything. Convenient but noisier and more crowded.

**Penestanan / Sayan (west of center):** River valley setting, quieter, home to some of Bali's best luxury resorts. 5-10 minutes from the center by scooter.

**Tegallalang direction (north):** Rice terrace views, more remote, requires transport for everything. Beautiful but less convenient.

**Mas / Lodtunduh (south):** Quieter villages with good value accommodation. 10-15 minutes from the center.

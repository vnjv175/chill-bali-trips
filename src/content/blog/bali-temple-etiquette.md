Bali has over 20,000 temples — more temples than homes, by some counts. They are the spiritual backbone of the island, central to daily Balinese life in a way that goes far beyond tourism or historical preservation. Every village has at least three temples. Every compound has a family temple. And on any given day, you'll see Balinese people in ceremonial dress carrying offerings to one of these sacred spaces.

For visitors, temples are among Bali's most compelling attractions — architecturally stunning, culturally fascinating, and often set in dramatic natural landscapes. But they are, first and foremost, active places of worship. Understanding the etiquette isn't just about following rules — it's about respecting a living spiritual tradition that has shaped this island for over a thousand years.

This guide covers the essential etiquette for temple visits, followed by a curated list of the most impressive temples to include in your Bali itinerary.

## Temple Etiquette: The Essential Rules

### Dress Code

This is the most important and most frequently violated rule. Balinese temples require modest clothing for all visitors:

**Required:**
- A sarong wrapped around your lower body, covering your legs to at least below the knee
- A sash (selendang) tied around your waist over the sarong
- Covered shoulders — no tank tops, singlets, or bikini tops

**In practice:** Most major temples provide sarong and sash rental (or loan) at the entrance, usually for a small fee (10,000-20,000 IDR) or included with the entrance ticket. However, carrying your own sarong shows respect and saves time. You can buy attractive sarongs at any Balinese market for $3-5.

**For men:** Long pants or a sarong, a shirt with sleeves (short sleeves are fine), and a sash.

**For women:** A sarong over your legs, a top that covers shoulders, and a sash. Some temples also ask women to tie their hair back.

### Menstruation

Balinese custom prohibits menstruating women from entering temples. This applies to both Balinese women and visitors. There are no checks or enforcement — it operates on the honor system — but it's a deeply held belief. Many temples have signs at the entrance stating this rule. If this applies to you, you can still appreciate the temple's exterior architecture and grounds.

### During Ceremonies

If you visit during an active ceremony (which is common and can be a wonderful experience):

- **Stay on the periphery.** Don't walk through the middle of a prayer group or ceremony.
- **Sit lower than the priest.** If you sit down to observe, choose a position where your head is lower than the priest conducting the ceremony. This is a sign of respect.
- **Ask before photographing.** Most Balinese people are generous about photos, but during prayer and ceremonies, ask first or keep a respectful distance with a longer lens.
- **Don't touch offerings.** The beautifully arranged offerings (canang sari) you see everywhere are sacred. Don't move them, step on them, or pick them up for photos.
- **Silence your phone.** This should go without saying, but a ringing phone during a ceremony is deeply disrespectful.

### Physical Behavior

- **Never climb on temple walls, statues, or structures** for photos. This is disrespectful and increasingly leads to access restrictions for all visitors.
- **Don't point with your index finger** at sacred objects or statues. If you need to indicate something, gesture with your whole hand, palm facing up.
- **Don't stand above a shrine or priest.** In Balinese culture, the head is sacred and should not be positioned above sacred objects or holy people.
- **Walk around temple structures clockwise** when circumnavigating them, which follows the traditional direction of devotion.
- **Remove your shoes** before entering the inner sanctum of any temple. Not all temples require this at the outer areas, but if you see a threshold or doorway marked for entry, take your shoes off.

### Offerings and Holy Water

At some temples, particularly Tirta Empul, visitors are invited to participate in purification rituals. This is a genuine spiritual practice, not a tourist attraction:

- If you participate, approach it with sincerity and follow the instructions of temple attendants
- Don't treat it as a photo opportunity — experiencing the ritual and photographing it simultaneously diminishes both
- A small donation to the temple is customary after participating

### Photography

Photography is generally permitted in the outer areas of most temples. However:

- Inner sanctums and ceremony areas may be off-limits for photos
- Always check for signs indicating photo restrictions
- Flash photography is often prohibited
- Drone photography is increasingly banned at temples — check specific regulations
- Prioritize the experience over the photo. A common complaint from Balinese people is visitors who spend their entire temple visit taking selfies without pausing to appreciate the spiritual significance of where they are

## The 15 Best Temples to Visit

### The Iconic Must-Visits

#### 1. Uluwatu Temple (Pura Luhur Uluwatu)

Perched on a 70-meter limestone cliff overlooking the Indian Ocean, Uluwatu is one of Bali's most dramatically situated temples. Built in the 11th century, it's one of six key temples believed to protect Bali from evil spirits. The cliff-edge setting is breathtaking, and the daily Kecak fire dance performance at sunset (6 PM) is one of the island's most unmissable cultural experiences — dozens of men chanting in concentric circles as the sun drops into the sea.

**Practical notes:** Watch out for the monkeys — they're aggressive and will steal sunglasses, hats, phones, and anything shiny. Don't carry food openly. Sarongs are provided at the entrance. Kecak dance tickets sell separately (100,000 IDR) and sell out on busy days — arrive by 5 PM.

**Location:** [Uluwatu](/areas/uluwatu/)
**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

#### 2. Tanah Lot

Bali's most photographed temple sits on a rock formation in the sea, connected to the mainland only at low tide. The silhouette of the temple against a sunset sky has become one of the most iconic images of Indonesia. You can't enter the temple itself (only Balinese Hindus may), but the rock base is accessible at low tide, and a holy spring at its base is believed to have protective powers.

**Practical notes:** Sunset is the iconic time to visit, but the crowds are immense. Early morning visits offer a quieter, equally beautiful experience. The surrounding complex has expanded into a tourist market — commercial but not without charm.

**Entrance fee:** 60,000 IDR

#### 3. Tirta Empul

The sacred water temple is one of Bali's most spiritually significant sites. Built around a natural spring that Balinese Hindus believe has purifying properties, Tirta Empul allows visitors to participate in the melukat (purification) ritual — wading through a series of fountains while offering prayers. The experience is moving and profound when approached with genuine respect.

**Practical notes:** Wear your own sarong (you'll be in water). The ritual involves getting fully wet, so wear swimwear under your temple clothing. Early morning visits are less crowded and more atmospheric. A guide who can explain the significance of each fountain enhances the experience greatly.

**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

#### 4. Besakih (Mother Temple)

The largest and holiest temple complex in Bali, Besakih sits on the slopes of Mount Agung (Bali's highest peak and most sacred mountain). The complex comprises over 80 individual temples arranged up the mountainside, and ceremonies take place almost daily. The scale is impressive — this is the spiritual center of Balinese Hinduism.

**Practical notes:** Besakih has a reputation for aggressive touts and "unofficial guides" who pressure visitors. Use an official guide (arranged through the ticket office) or book a [temple tour](/activities/temple-tours/) with a trusted operator. Early morning visits offer the best light and fewer crowds. Cloud cover on Mount Agung is common by midday.

**Entrance fee:** 60,000 IDR (plus guide fee)

### The Instagram-Famous

#### 5. Lempuyang Temple (Gates of Heaven)

The split gate (candi bentar) framing Mount Agung has become one of the most shared images in travel photography. The queue for the photo can stretch to 2-3 hours during peak season — a testament to Instagram's influence on travel behavior. Beyond the famous gate, the full Lempuyang complex includes seven temples along a steep trail up Mount Lempuyang, offering genuinely rewarding hiking and spiritual exploration for those willing to go beyond the photo op.

**Practical notes:** Arrive at opening time (6 AM) to beat the queue. The mirror-reflection effect in many photos is artificial — created by placing a phone screen below the camera. The full temple trek takes 3-4 hours and is far more rewarding than the gate photo alone.

**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

#### 6. Tirta Gangga Water Palace

Not technically a temple but a former royal palace built around sacred water features — ornamental pools, fountains, and stepping-stone paths surrounded by lush gardens. The setting is serene and photogenic, with koi-filled pools reflecting the surrounding mountains. It's a peaceful counterpoint to the larger, busier temple complexes.

**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

### The Spiritual Deep-Cuts

#### 7. Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave)

Dating to the 9th century, this archaeological site features a carved cave entrance depicting a demonic face, ancient bathing pools, and fragments of Buddhist stupas — evidence of Bali's pre-Hindu Buddhist history. The cave is small but atmospheric, and the surrounding jungle setting adds to the sense of age and mystery.

**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

#### 8. Gunung Kawi

Eleven massive 7-meter-tall stone shrines (candi) carved directly into the rock face of a river valley. Gunung Kawi dates to the 11th century and remains one of Bali's most impressive archaeological sites. The approach — 300+ steps descending through rice terraces — is beautiful, and the valley itself feels like a hidden world.

**Entrance fee:** 50,000 IDR

#### 9. Pura Kehen

The state temple of the former Bangli kingdom, Pura Kehen is an enormous, multi-terraced temple complex built into a forested hillside. Massive banyan trees shade the courtyards, and the carved stone architecture is among the finest on the island. It sees a fraction of the visitors of the south coast temples, despite being equally impressive.

**Entrance fee:** 30,000 IDR

#### 10. Taman Ayun

The grand royal temple of the Mengwi kingdom, Taman Ayun is surrounded by a moat and set within expansive gardens. The multi-tiered meru towers (pagoda-like structures) are some of the tallest and most photogenic on the island. The surrounding park is perfect for a peaceful stroll. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

**Entrance fee:** 30,000 IDR

### The Ceremonial Experiences

#### 11. Ubud Palace (Puri Saren Agung)

The royal palace in the heart of [Ubud](/areas/ubud/) hosts nightly traditional dance performances — Legong, Barong, and Ramayana — in its ornately decorated courtyard. The setting is intimate and atmospheric, with gamelan orchestras providing live accompaniment. Performance tickets are affordable (80,000-100,000 IDR) and this is one of the most accessible ways to experience Balinese performing arts.

#### 12. Ulun Danu Bratan

Sitting on the shores of Lake Bratan in the central highlands, Ulun Danu Bratan is one of the most visually striking temples in Bali. The multi-tiered meru towers appear to float on the lake, and the surrounding mountains and gardens create a serene, almost mystical atmosphere. Morning mist often adds a dreamlike quality. The temple features on the Indonesian 50,000 IDR banknote.

**Entrance fee:** 75,000 IDR

### The Off-the-Beaten-Path

#### 13. Pura Ulun Danu Batur

After the original temple was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1926, it was rebuilt higher on the caldera rim of Mount Batur. The temple overlooks the volcanic lake and the still-active volcano — a potent reminder of the relationship between Balinese spirituality and the natural forces that shape the island. Far less visited than its cousin on Lake Bratan.

#### 14. Pura Lempuyang Luhur (Full Trek)

The full trek to the summit temple of Mount Lempuyang involves climbing over 1,700 steps through moss-covered forest. It's physically demanding but spiritually rewarding — each of the seven temples along the route marks a stage of spiritual ascent. Very few tourists make the full climb, so the upper temples offer genuine solitude and sweeping views.

#### 15. Pura Goa Lawah (Bat Cave Temple)

Built around a cave inhabited by thousands of bats, Goa Lawah is an active, significant temple that most tourists skip in favor of the bigger names. The bat colony is fascinating (if slightly unnerving), and the temple's coastal location in East Bali makes it a natural stop on the way to Amed or Candidasa. Ceremonies here are frequent and elaborate.

**Entrance fee:** 30,000 IDR

## Planning Your Temple Visits

**How many temples?** For a week-long trip, 3-5 temple visits is ideal. More than that and temple fatigue sets in. Prioritize based on your interests — dramatic settings (Uluwatu, Tanah Lot), spiritual participation (Tirta Empul), archaeological significance (Gunung Kawi, Goa Gajah), or photography (Lempuyang, Ulun Danu Bratan).

**Best time of day:** Early morning (before 9 AM) for cooler temperatures, better light, and fewer crowds. Sunset for Uluwatu (Kecak dance) and Tanah Lot.

**Guided vs. solo:** A knowledgeable guide transforms a temple visit from sightseeing into genuine cultural education. Without context, you're looking at beautiful architecture. With a guide, you understand the stories, symbolism, and living traditions behind every carved stone. Consider booking a [temple tour](/activities/temple-tours/) for the deeper experience.

## Let Gede Guide Your Temple Experience

Temple visits are where local knowledge makes the biggest difference. Gede can time your visits to coincide with ceremonies (a far richer experience than visiting an empty temple), navigate the guide and tout situations at temples like Besakih, explain the cultural significance that transforms sightseeing into understanding, and build an itinerary that balances iconic sites with lesser-known temples that most visitors never discover.

Bali has over 100 kilometers of coastline, and the beaches vary so dramatically that you could spend a month here and never visit the same type of beach twice. The southern tip hides secret coves beneath towering limestone cliffs. The west coast offers wide sandy stretches perfect for surfing and sunsets. The east coast reveals volcanic black sand shores with calm waters and coral reefs. And the offshore islands — Nusa Penida, Lembongan, Ceningan — have some of the most spectacular coastal scenery in Southeast Asia.

This guide covers 30 of the best beaches on the island, organized by region, with honest notes on what each one is actually like — the swimming conditions, the crowds, the access, and who each beach is best suited for.

## South Bali & Bukit Peninsula

The Bukit Peninsula (the southern tip of Bali) has the most dramatic coastline on the island. White sand beaches sit at the base of towering limestone cliffs, accessed by steep staircases carved into the rock. The water is typically crystal-clear, the surf is world-class, and the landscape feels almost Mediterranean.

### 1. Padang Padang Beach

The beach that Julia Roberts made famous in *Eat Pray Love*, Padang Padang is a small cove of white sand wedged between limestone cliffs, accessed through a narrow cave-like opening in the rock. The beach is tiny — which means it gets crowded by midday — but the setting is genuinely spectacular. The water is calm enough for swimming in the shallows, and experienced surfers head to the outer reef for some of the best waves in Bali.

**Best for:** Photography, swimming (calm days), expert surfing
**Crowd level:** High (especially 10 AM - 3 PM)
**Access:** Easy — stairs through a rock cave from the parking area
**Tip:** Arrive before 9 AM for photos without crowds

### 2. Dreamland Beach

A wide crescent of white sand backed by cliffs, Dreamland is more spacious than most Bukit beaches and has consistent beach-break waves that suit intermediate surfers. The swimming is decent in calm conditions, but there can be a strong undertow — pay attention to the flags. Sun loungers and warungs line the beach, giving it a more developed feel than its neighbors.

**Best for:** Surfing (intermediate), sunbathing, beach walks
**Crowd level:** Moderate
**Access:** Easy — short walk from parking

### 3. Bingin Beach

One of the Bukit's most atmospheric beaches, Bingin sits below a cluster of clifftop warungs and guesthouses that feel like a surf village frozen in time. The beach is narrow and rocky at high tide, but at low tide a stretch of white sand appears. The surf break here is excellent for intermediate-to-advanced surfers. The vibe is decidedly laid-back and counter-cultural.

**Best for:** Surfing, backpacker vibes, sunsets from the cliff above
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate
**Access:** Moderate — steep stairs from the clifftop
**Tip:** Time your visit for low tide when the sand is exposed

### 4. Balangan Beach

A long, curving beach with golden sand, dramatic cliff views, and a famous left-hand surf break. Balangan has a wilder, less developed feel than nearby Dreamland — a handful of simple warungs with beanbags and cold beers rather than organized lounger rentals. The sunset views from the cliff above the beach are among the best in Bali.

**Best for:** Surfing (intermediate-advanced), sunsets, photography
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate
**Access:** Easy — stairs from clifftop parking

### 5. Nyang Nyang Beach

This is the beach for people who think Bali's beaches are too crowded. Nyang Nyang requires a 500-step descent down a cliff face, which keeps most visitors away. What you find at the bottom is a vast, pristine sweep of white sand — often nearly empty — with turquoise water and a shipwreck rusting picturesquely on the shore. The swim back up the stairs is the price of admission.

**Best for:** Solitude, photography, adventure
**Crowd level:** Very low
**Access:** Difficult — 500+ steps each way
**Tip:** Bring water and snacks — there are no vendors

### 6. Green Bowl Beach

Another cliff-access beach with limestone caves, white sand, and remarkably clear water. Green Bowl is popular with snorkelers when conditions are calm, as the reef is accessible close to shore. The caves provide shade during the heat of the day. Like Nyang Nyang, the long staircase keeps crowds thin.

**Best for:** Snorkeling, cave exploration, seclusion
**Crowd level:** Low
**Access:** Difficult — 300+ steep steps

### 7. Pandawa Beach

Carved out of a limestone cliff face, Pandawa Beach was a hidden gem until the access road was built and it became one of the Bukit's most popular beaches. The water is calm and clear, making it one of the best swimming beaches on the peninsula. Seaweed farming in the shallows adds a unique visual element. It's more organized than most Bukit beaches, with sun lounger rentals, water sports, and cliff-top viewpoints.

**Best for:** Swimming, families, water sports
**Crowd level:** Moderate-high
**Access:** Easy — drive right down to the beach

## West Coast (Seminyak, Canggu, Pererenan)

The west coast beaches are wide, sandy, and sunset-facing. The sand is darker than the Bukit (ranging from golden to grey-black), the waves are consistent, and the beach infrastructure — clubs, bars, restaurants — is the most developed on the island.

### 8. Seminyak Beach

The social beach. Seminyak's long stretch of grey-gold sand is lined with beach clubs, bars, and sunset loungers. The swimming is decent but watch for rip currents. The real draw is the scene — cold beers, people-watching, and some of the best sunsets in Bali. The famous Ku De Ta and Potato Head are right on this stretch.

**Best for:** Sunset drinks, socializing, beach clubs
**Crowd level:** High
**Area:** [Seminyak](/areas/seminyak/)

### 9. Double Six Beach

The southern extension of Seminyak Beach, Double Six has a slightly more relaxed vibe and excellent sunset-watching infrastructure — colorful beanbags and low tables laid out directly on the sand by the beachfront bars. The swimming is reasonable in calm conditions. It's one of the most photogenic sunset spots on the island.

**Best for:** Sunset beanbag sessions, couples, photography
**Crowd level:** Moderate-high

### 10. Batu Bolong Beach

The heart of [Canggu's](/areas/canggu/) beach culture. Batu Bolong is where surfers, yogis, digital nomads, and families converge around a consistent beach break and a strip of beachfront cafes. The surf is suitable for beginners and intermediates, [surf lessons](/activities/surfing-lessons/) are widely available, and the temple (Pura Batu Bolong) perched on a rocky outcrop at the north end adds a photogenic focal point.

**Best for:** Surfing (all levels), social beach, sunset
**Crowd level:** Moderate-high

### 11. Echo Beach

Further north along the Canggu coast, Echo Beach has a more rugged character. The sand is darker (nearly black), the waves are bigger and better suited to intermediate-plus surfers, and the vibe is less polished. La Brisa and Echo Beach Club sit along this stretch, providing sunset drinks and food with direct beach access.

**Best for:** Surfing (intermediate-advanced), beach clubs, raw coastal scenery
**Crowd level:** Moderate

### 12. Pererenan Beach

The quieter neighbor to Canggu's busy beaches, [Pererenan](/areas/pererenan/) feels like stepping back a few years in Bali's development timeline. The black sand beach is wide, the crowds are thinner, and the surf is good for intermediates. Beach warungs here are simpler and cheaper than the Canggu scene. It's where Canggu locals go when they want to escape Canggu tourists.

**Best for:** Surfing, solitude, authentic vibe
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate

### 13. Balian Beach

An hour's drive northwest of Canggu, Balian is a black sand beach at the mouth of a river, attracting surfers with its consistent left-hand break. The area has a remote, end-of-the-road feel — simple guesthouses, a handful of cafes, and not much else. If you're looking for the Bali surf experience without the Canggu scene, Balian delivers.

**Best for:** Surfing, off-the-beaten-path travel, quiet retreat
**Crowd level:** Very low

## East Coast & Northeast

The east coast is Bali's quieter, more traditional side. Black volcanic sand beaches slope gently into calm waters, coral reefs sit close to shore, and the pace of life is noticeably slower.

### 14. Sanur Beach

Bali's original tourist beach predates the Kuta/Seminyak development by decades. The reef-protected waters are calm, the sand is pale, and a paved beach path runs the full length of the shore. Morning is the best time — the sunrise over Nusa Penida is spectacular, and local joggers, tai chi practitioners, and fishermen create a charming scene. Sanur is the departure point for fast boats to the Nusa islands.

**Best for:** Families, sunrise, calm swimming, boat departures
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate

### 15. Amed Beach

A series of small bays along the far northeast coast, Amed is one of Bali's best-kept secrets for snorkeling and [diving](/activities/snorkeling-diving/). The coral reef starts right at the water's edge, and the marine life includes everything from colorful reef fish to the occasional reef shark. The volcanic black sand beaches are dramatic, and the views of Mount Agung rising directly behind the coast are stunning. It's a 2.5-hour drive from the airport, which keeps mass tourism away.

**Best for:** Snorkeling, diving, quiet getaway, Mount Agung views
**Crowd level:** Very low

### 16. Tulamben Beach

Famous for the USAT Liberty shipwreck — a World War II cargo ship that sits just 30 meters offshore in 5-30 meters of water. The wreck is one of the most accessible [dive sites](/activities/snorkeling-diving/) in the world and can even be explored by snorkelers from the surface. The beach itself is rocky (volcanic pebbles rather than sand), but the underwater scenery more than compensates.

**Best for:** Diving, snorkeling, USAT Liberty wreck
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate

### 17. Pasir Putih (White Sand Beach / Virgin Beach)

Tucked away in East Bali near Candidasa, Pasir Putih is one of the few white sand beaches on the east coast. It's reached via a short walk through a local village (small entrance fee required), and the beach is backed by hills and dotted with traditional outrigger boats. The water is calm and swimmable, and simple warungs serve grilled fish and cold drinks right on the sand.

**Best for:** Swimming, relaxed beach day, grilled seafood
**Crowd level:** Low

### 18. Bias Tugel Beach

A small, hidden cove near Padang Bai (the ferry port for Lombok). Bias Tugel requires a short, somewhat steep walk through the trees, but the reward is a beautiful crescent of white sand with clear, calm water. It's one of the few genuinely swimmable beaches in East Bali and rarely crowded.

**Best for:** Swimming, snorkeling, quiet beach day
**Crowd level:** Low

## North Coast

### 19. Lovina Beach

The north coast's main beach area, [Lovina](/areas/lovina/) is known for calm, waveless water and spectacular [dolphin watching](/activities/dolphin-watching/) at sunrise. The beach itself is black volcanic sand, wide and uncrowded. The tourism infrastructure here is simpler and more budget-friendly than the south. The reef offshore offers decent snorkeling, and the general atmosphere is relaxed and unhurried.

**Best for:** Dolphin watching, budget travel, calm water, relaxation
**Crowd level:** Very low

### 20. Pemuteran Beach

On the far northwest coast, Pemuteran sits next to Bali's best marine protected area. The Biorock reef restoration project has rebuilt coral gardens that now teem with marine life. The diving and snorkeling here are arguably the best on the Bali mainland, and the beach itself — while not a classic postcard beauty — is clean, quiet, and backed by dry, mountainous landscape that feels completely different from Bali's south coast.

**Best for:** Diving, snorkeling, reef conservation, quiet escape
**Crowd level:** Very low

## Nusa Islands

The three Nusa islands (Penida, Lembongan, and Ceningan) offer some of the most dramatic coastal scenery in the region. Reached by fast boat from Sanur or Padang Bai, they're easily visited as [day trips](/activities/nusa-penida-day-trip/) or multi-day stays.

### 21. Kelingking Beach (Nusa Penida)

The T-Rex-shaped cliff viewpoint at Kelingking has become one of the most iconic images of Bali. The beach below is accessible via a steep, challenging trail that takes 30-45 minutes down (and considerably longer back up). The beach itself is stunning — pristine white sand, turquoise water, towering cliffs — but the swim can be dangerous due to strong currents.

**Best for:** Photography (viewpoint), adventure (beach descent)
**Crowd level:** High at viewpoint, low at beach
**Tip:** The viewpoint is the main attraction — only descend if you're fit and sure-footed

### 22. Crystal Bay (Nusa Penida)

The best swimming beach on Nusa Penida, Crystal Bay has calm, clear water protected by a small offshore island. The snorkeling is excellent, with a chance of spotting mola mola (ocean sunfish) during the right season (July-October). The beach is white sand, reasonably spacious, and has basic food and drink vendors.

**Best for:** Swimming, snorkeling, mola mola season
**Crowd level:** Moderate

### 23. Atuh Beach (Nusa Penida)

A spectacular hidden beach accessed by a steep staircase, Atuh is flanked by towering rock arches and offshore rock formations. The setting is dramatic — almost surreal — and far less visited than Kelingking. The water is generally calm enough for swimming, and the beach is backed by simple warungs.

**Best for:** Photography, swimming, off-the-beaten-path
**Crowd level:** Low

### 24. Diamond Beach (Nusa Penida)

Adjacent to Atuh and accessed by a recently improved staircase, Diamond Beach gets its name from the sparkling quality of its white sand. The jagged limestone formations and crystal-clear water make it one of the most photogenic beaches on the Nusa islands. Swimming is possible but check conditions — currents can be strong.

**Best for:** Photography, dramatic scenery
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate

### 25. Mushroom Bay (Nusa Lembongan)

A sheltered white-sand bay on Nusa Lembongan's west coast, Mushroom Bay is one of the calmest and most swimmable beaches in the entire Bali region. The water is shallow, clear, and warm, making it perfect for families and non-swimmers. Beach clubs and restaurants line the shore without overwhelming it. Sunset here is gorgeous.

**Best for:** Swimming, families, sunset, relaxation
**Crowd level:** Low-moderate

### 26. Dream Beach (Nusa Lembongan)

A more dramatic alternative to Mushroom Bay, Dream Beach is a small cove of white sand backed by cliffs. The waves can be rough (swimming isn't always safe), but the scenery is stunning. A cliffside bar overlooks the beach and serves cold drinks with one of the best views on the island.

**Best for:** Photography, cliff-bar drinks, scenery
**Crowd level:** Low

## Surf Beaches (The Essential List)

For surfers, Bali's waves are the main attraction. Here are the essential surf beaches beyond those already mentioned.

### 27. Uluwatu (Surf Break)

The most famous wave in Bali — and one of the most famous in the world. A long, barreling left-hander that breaks over a shallow reef below the Uluwatu cliffs. This is an advanced-only wave with serious consequences for mistakes. Access is through a cave in the cliff face. Even if you don't surf, watching from the cliffs above is mesmerizing.

**Best for:** Advanced surfing, spectating
**Best season:** April-October (dry season)

### 28. Impossibles

A long, fast left-hand reef break between Bingin and Padang Padang. Named for its treacherous cliff access (historically considered "impossible"), it now has an improved path. The wave is excellent for advanced surfers — long rides, hollow sections, and consistent swell. The beach at the base is rocky and limited.

**Best for:** Advanced surfing
**Crowd level:** Moderate (among surfers)

### 29. Keramas

Bali's premier east-coast wave and a regular stop on the World Surf League tour. Keramas is a powerful right-hander that breaks over a shallow reef. Best during wet season (November-March) when the east coast picks up swell. The night surfing option (under floodlights at the Komune resort) is a unique Bali experience.

**Best for:** Advanced surfing, WSL spectating, night surfing
**Best season:** November-March (wet season)

### 30. Medewi

Bali's longest wave — a mellow left-hand point break on the far west coast that produces rides of 200+ meters on good days. Medewi attracts longboarders and intermediate surfers looking for long, cruisy waves without the crowd pressure of the south coast. The surrounding area is rural and undeveloped, offering a glimpse of old Bali.

**Best for:** Longboarding, intermediate surfers, uncrowded waves
**Crowd level:** Very low

## Practical Beach Tips

- **Swim between the flags** where available, and respect the red flag warnings — Bali's rip currents claim lives every year
- **Protect your valuables** — don't leave phones, wallets, or bags unattended on the beach
- **Wear reef-safe sunscreen** — the coral reefs that make Bali's waters so beautiful are fragile and chemical sunscreen contributes to bleaching
- **Low tide vs. high tide** matters enormously — some beaches disappear at high tide, while others are rocky and unswimmable at low tide. Check tide charts before visiting cliff-base beaches
- **Hiring a [private driver](/activities/private-driver/)** is the best way to visit multiple beaches in a day, especially on the Bukit Peninsula where parking is limited and roads are narrow

Bali has more waterfalls than any island this size has a right to. They cascade out of jungle-covered cliffs, hide behind cave walls, and thunder into deep turquoise pools that beg you to jump in. Some are easy enough for your grandmother to visit. Others require scrambling down muddy ravines while holding onto tree roots.

This guide covers 24 of the best, organized by difficulty so you can match the adventure to your fitness level and comfort zone. Every waterfall includes what you need to know before you go.

## Easy Access (Anyone Can Visit)

These waterfalls require minimal walking and are suitable for families, older travelers, and anyone who does not want to arrive at the bottom of a ravine drenched in sweat.

### 1. Tegenungan Waterfall

**Location:** Gianyar (20 minutes south of Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy — well-maintained stairs, about 10 minutes down

The most visited waterfall in Bali, and for good reason. Tegenungan is wide, powerful, and photogenic, with a large swimming pool at the base. The stairs down are paved and have railings. Arrive before 9 AM to beat the crowds and get the best photos without 50 people in the background.

**Tip:** There is a second, less-known viewpoint on the opposite side of the river, accessed from a different entrance. It is far quieter and gives you a completely different angle.

### 2. Tibumana Waterfall

**Location:** Bangli (30 minutes east of Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 15,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy — flat path through bamboo forest, 10 minutes

A hidden gem that is finally getting the attention it deserves. Tibumana falls about 20 meters into a clear, calm pool perfect for swimming. The walk in is through a beautiful bamboo forest, and the waterfall itself rarely gets crowded. This is one of the best swimming waterfalls on the island.

### 3. Kanto Lampo Waterfall

**Location:** Gianyar (25 minutes from Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 15,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy — short walk and a few stairs

Kanto Lampo is unlike any other waterfall in Bali. Instead of a single drop, water cascades down a staircase of smooth rocks, creating a fan-shaped curtain of water that is incredibly photogenic. You can sit on the rocks with water flowing around you for a unique shot. It is smaller than the big falls but the visual effect is striking.

**Tip:** The water flow varies dramatically with rain. Visit during or right after wet season for the best volume. In dry season it can be a trickle.

### 4. Tukad Cepung Waterfall

**Location:** Bangli (45 minutes northeast of Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 15,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate — short hike through a river gorge, some scrambling over rocks

Tukad Cepung is Bali's most otherworldly waterfall. You walk through a narrow canyon until you reach a cave-like opening where sunlight streams through the rock ceiling, illuminating the waterfall in shafts of golden light. It feels like stepping into a cathedral made by nature.

**Tip:** Visit between 9 AM and 11 AM when the sun is at the right angle to create the light rays. Overcast days reduce the effect dramatically. Bring a waterproof bag for your phone.

### 5. Blangsinga Waterfall (Tegenungan's Neighbor)

**Location:** Gianyar (near Tegenungan)
**Entrance fee:** 15,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy — well-maintained stairs

Just a few hundred meters from Tegenungan but with a fraction of the visitors. Blangsinga drops into a deep, clear pool surrounded by jungle. The cliff jump from the rocks above is popular with thrill seekers (check the depth before jumping). A rope swing has been added in recent years.

### 6. Leke Leke Waterfall

**Location:** Tabanan (40 minutes northwest of Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 30,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Easy — beautiful trail through forest, about 15 minutes

A slender, elegant waterfall dropping into a small grotto. The walk in is one of the best parts — a well-maintained path through dense tropical forest with informational signs about the local ecosystem. Leke Leke feels like a miniature Sekumpul without the challenging access.

---

## Moderate (Some Fitness Required)

These waterfalls involve longer walks, steeper stairs, or some scrambling. Good shoes are recommended, and you should be comfortable walking for 20-40 minutes on uneven terrain.

### 7. Gitgit Waterfall

**Location:** Singaraja, North Bali (near [Lovina](/areas/lovina/))
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — about 340 stairs down (and back up)

One of North Bali's most famous falls, Gitgit drops 35 meters into a deep pool surrounded by towering trees and tropical plants. The walk down passes through a gauntlet of souvenir sellers, but the waterfall itself is impressive. Less crowded than its southern counterparts thanks to its North Bali location.

### 8. Munduk Waterfall

**Location:** Munduk, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — 20-minute walk through coffee and clove plantations

Set in the cool highlands of central-north Bali, Munduk waterfall drops 25 meters into a lush gorge. The approach through working [coffee](/activities/coffee-plantation-tour/) and clove plantations is fragrant and beautiful. There are actually three waterfalls in the area (Munduk, Melanting, and Golden Valley) — you can visit all three on a single trek.

### 9. Banyumala Twin Waterfalls

**Location:** Wanagiri, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 30,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — steep stairs down (about 15 minutes), slippery when wet

Two parallel waterfalls dropping into a wide, shallow pool perfect for swimming. Banyumala is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Bali and still feels relatively undiscovered. The pool at the base is large enough that even with other visitors, you have space to yourself. The stairs down are steep and can be slippery — wear proper shoes.

### 10. Aling-Aling Waterfall

**Location:** Singaraja, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR (or 125,000 IDR with guide for cliff jumping)
**Difficulty:** Moderate — stairs and trail, about 20 minutes

Aling-Aling is unique because it offers guided cliff jumping and natural water slides at the falls below the main cascade. The main waterfall itself is a 35-meter curtain of water that you view from a distance, but the real fun happens at the lower pools where you can jump from heights of 5 meters, 10 meters, or (if you are brave) 15 meters into deep pools. A local guide is required for the jumping section and is included in the higher ticket price.

### 11. Nungnung Waterfall

**Location:** Tabanan (1.5 hours northwest of [Ubud](/areas/ubud/))
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate to Hard — over 500 stairs down (and the same back up)

Nungnung is raw power. This 50-meter waterfall crashes down with such force that the spray soaks you from 20 meters away. The pool at the base is massive and the setting is dramatic — sheer rock walls on all sides with dense jungle above. The challenge is the 500+ stairs, which are brutal on the way back up. Bring water and take your time.

**Tip:** Go early when the morning light hits the falls. And clear your schedule afterwards because your legs will need rest.

### 12. Air Terjun Yeh Mampeh

**Location:** Near Lovina, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — jungle trail, about 30 minutes

One of the tallest waterfalls in Bali at approximately 40 meters. Yeh Mampeh is rarely visited, which means you might have it entirely to yourself. The trail passes through a forest rich with birdlife and butterflies. The pool at the base is shallow but the sheer scale of the falls makes the hike worthwhile.

### 13. Kuning Waterfall

**Location:** Near Kintamani
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — downhill trail through bamboo forest

A lesser-known waterfall near the Mount Batur area. The trail down passes through towering bamboo groves that block out most of the sunlight, creating an atmospheric approach. The waterfall itself is modest in size but the setting is peaceful and rarely crowded. Good to combine with a [Mount Batur sunrise trek](/activities/mount-batur-sunrise-trek/) or hot springs visit.

### 14. Dusun Kuning Waterfall

**Location:** Bangli (40 minutes from Ubud)
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate — river crossing and rocky trail

A powerful waterfall hidden in a deep gorge. Getting here involves crossing a river (usually knee-deep) and navigating some rocky terrain. The effort keeps the crowds away. The waterfall itself is about 25 meters and the gorge setting makes it feel wild and remote, even though you are not far from Ubud.

## Challenging (For Adventurous Travelers)

These waterfalls require genuine hiking, scrambling, or navigating steep and sometimes slippery terrain. Good shoes, reasonable fitness, and a sense of adventure are prerequisites.

### 15. Sekumpul Waterfall

**Location:** Singaraja, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR (plus 30,000-50,000 IDR for a local guide, recommended)
**Difficulty:** Hard — steep descent with over 300 stairs, river crossings, slippery trails

Often called the most beautiful waterfall in Bali, and it is hard to argue. Sekumpul is actually a cluster of waterfalls — multiple streams dropping from a height of about 80 meters into a deep valley of dense tropical rainforest. The tallest cascade is the centerpiece, but the surrounding smaller falls create a panorama that is genuinely breathtaking.

The access is demanding. The trail down involves steep stairs, muddy paths (especially in wet season), and crossing a river. A local guide is strongly recommended — they know the safest route and will carry your belongings across the river crossing. The hike back up is the real workout.

**Tip:** Plan at least 3-4 hours for the full visit including the hike in and out. Bring water, a towel, and a change of clothes.

### 16. Fiji Waterfall (Hidden Canyon)

**Location:** Near Sekumpul, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** Included with Sekumpul area fee
**Difficulty:** Hard — requires scrambling through a narrow canyon

Near Sekumpul, Fiji waterfall is reached by walking through a narrow canyon with sheer walls on both sides. The water is waist-deep in places. The payoff is a tall, narrow waterfall dropping into a tight gorge that feels completely untouched. This is not for those uncomfortable in confined spaces or rushing water.

### 17. Carat Waterfall

**Location:** West Bali
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Hard — jungle trail, river crossings, minimal signage

One of Bali's most remote accessible waterfalls. Carat requires walking through dense jungle with minimal trail markings. A local guide is essentially mandatory. The waterfall itself is a tall, thin stream dropping into a pristine pool in a setting that feels untouched by tourism. You will likely be the only visitor.

### 18. Singsing Waterfall

**Location:** Near Lovina, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate to Hard — steep trail, about 25 minutes

A double-tiered waterfall in North Bali. The lower falls are relatively easy to reach, but the upper tier requires more scrambling. The combination of both tiers creates a beautiful scene, and the pool at the lower falls is deep enough for swimming. Combine with a [dolphin watching](/activities/dolphin-watching/) trip in Lovina for a full North Bali day.

### 19. Jagasatru Waterfall

**Location:** Karangasem, East Bali
**Entrance fee:** Free (donations appreciated)
**Difficulty:** Moderate — located in a village, short walk from parking

Unique because it is literally in a village — the waterfall drops right next to houses. The 15-meter cascade is impressively powerful during wet season. Access is easy but the location off the beaten path means few tourists visit. A genuinely local experience.

### 20. Cemara Waterfall

**Location:** Near Sambangan, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Hard — jungle trail, steep descent

Part of the Sambangan Secret Garden waterfall circuit, Cemara requires a committed jungle trek. The reward is a powerful waterfall in a pristine setting with a deep swimming pool. The Sambangan area has multiple falls that can be visited in sequence — Cemara, Pucuk, Kembar, and Kroya — making for a full day of waterfall hopping.

### 21. Pucuk Waterfall

**Location:** Sambangan, North Bali
**Entrance fee:** Included in Sambangan circuit fee
**Difficulty:** Hard — steep stairs and trail

Another Sambangan waterfall, Pucuk drops about 15 meters into a clean pool. The gorge setting is dramatic with moss-covered walls and overhead jungle canopy. Best combined with the other Sambangan waterfalls for a full-day trek.

### 22. Kedung Tumpang Waterfall

**Location:** Tabanan, Central Bali
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Hard — requires navigation through rice fields and jungle

A genuinely hidden waterfall that most tourists never find. The trail passes through working rice fields and into dense forest. The waterfall drops about 20 meters into a natural pool. Coming here without a local guide means you will probably get lost.

### 23. Yeh Ho Waterfall

**Location:** Tabanan, West-Central Bali
**Entrance fee:** 10,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Hard — river trekking required

Reaching Yeh Ho involves walking upstream through the river itself — wading through water, stepping over boulders, and ducking under overhanging vegetation. The waterfall at the end is a multi-tiered cascade that few people ever see. This is an adventure in the truest sense.

### 24. Taman Beji Griya Waterfall

**Location:** Jembrana, West Bali
**Entrance fee:** 20,000 IDR
**Difficulty:** Moderate to Hard — trail through the jungle, river crossing

One of the westernmost waterfalls on the Bali tourist circuit. The trail passes through a monkey-inhabited forest to reach a secluded waterfall with a beautiful swimming hole. The remote location in West Bali means you are extremely unlikely to encounter other tourists.
